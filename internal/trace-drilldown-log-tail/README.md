# Trace Drilldown Log Tail

- **Status:** BUILDS (`go build ./internal/trace-drilldown-log-tail` passes)
- **Last checked:** 2025-09-18

## Notes
- Enhanced admin helpers and HTTP handlers now compile; runtime plumbing still needs real trace/log sources.
- Integration with distributed tracing remains minimalâ€”update once tracer endpoints are live.

## Next steps
- Flesh out `handleEnhancedPeek` to call the enhanced admin path instead of returning placeholders.
- Wire real log streaming (SSE/WebSocket) when backend support is ready.

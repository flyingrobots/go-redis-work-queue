# Collaborative Session Service

- **Status:** BUILDS (`go test ./internal/collaborative-session` succeeds; package contains runtime code only)
- **Last checked:** 2025-09-18

## Notes
- Core session manager compiles after restoring handoff helpers and transport hooks.
- No unit tests yet; behaviour still needs coverage once multiplayer UX stabilises.

## Next steps
- Add tests for control handoff, cleanup, and transport fan-out before exposing in CLI/TUI.

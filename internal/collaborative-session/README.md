# Collaborative Session Service

- **Status:** BUILDS (`go build ./internal/collaborative-session` passes; control handoff remains stubbed)
- **Last checked:** 2025-09-18

## Notes
- Core session manager compiles; control handoff currently returns a not-implemented error while transport/Event fan-out gets rebuilt.
- No unit tests yet; behaviour still needs coverage once multiplayer UX stabilises.

## Next steps
- Add tests for control handoff, cleanup, and transport fan-out before exposing in CLI/TUI.

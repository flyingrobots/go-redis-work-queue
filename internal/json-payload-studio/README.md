# JSON Payload Studio

- **Status:** BUILDS (`go build ./internal/json-payload-studio` passes; many endpoints still TODO)
- **Last checked:** 2025-09-18

## Notes
- Core studio methods (templates, sessions, completions) are stubbed in-memory so the package builds.
- HTTP endpoints remain scaffolding until persistence and validation are implemented.

## Next steps
- Wire real storage and validation logic before enabling the studio in production.

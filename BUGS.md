James… this little queue slaps. Not a toy. You’ve built a legit at-least-once work queue with:
	•	BRPOPLPUSH → per-worker processing list
	•	heartbeat key + reaper that SCANs jobqueue:worker:*:processing and requeues or DLQs
	•	priorities, exp backoff, DLQ, metrics, TUI, miniredis tests, circuit breaker, config via Viper

Now tighten the bolts. Here’s the no-BS punch list to get this production-ready:

Ship these 7 fixes
	1.	Renew heartbeats (you set it once, then pray).
Long tasks will “die” and get reaped mid-work. Refresh TTL while processing.

ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
defer cancel()
go func() {
  t := time.NewTicker(w.cfg.Worker.HeartbeatTTL / 3)
  defer t.Stop()
  for {
    select {
    case <-ctx.Done(): return
    case <-t.C:
      _ = w.rdb.Expire(ctx, hbKey, w.cfg.Worker.HeartbeatTTL).Err()
    }
  }
}()
// …do work… then cancel() right before LREM/DEL

	2.	Unify Redis client (pick v9, everywhere).
You’ve got github.com/go-redis/redis/v8 and redis/go-redis/v9. Pick v9, wrap it in your own interface{ Cmdable } for tests, and drop the duplicate dependency tree.
	3.	Lose any KEYS in admin paths.
I saw Keys( references in admin/handlers. Replace with SCAN (you already do in reaper). No accidental O(N) death spirals.

cur := uint64(0)
for {
  keys, next, _ := rdb.Scan(ctx, cur, "jobqueue:*", 500).Result()
  // ...
  if next == 0 { break }
  cur = next
}

	4.	Fairness across priorities.
Your “short block per queue in priority order” can starve low-prio. Introduce a tiny token bucket per priority (e.g., 8:2:1) so low priority gets a time slice even under high load.
	5.	Add scheduled jobs (delays/retries with a due date).
You already have backoff; give it teeth with a ZSET mover:

// enqueue delay: ZADD jobqueue:sched:<name> score=readyAt jobPayload
// tick:
for {
  ids, _ := rdb.ZRangeByScore(ctx, "jobqueue:sched:"+q, &redis.ZRangeBy{ Min:"-inf", Max:fmt.Sprint(time.Now().Unix()), Count:256 }).Result()
  if len(ids)==0 { break }
  pipe := rdb.TxPipeline()
  for _, p := range ids { pipe.LPush(ctx, qKey, p); pipe.ZRem(ctx, "jobqueue:sched:"+q, p) }
  _, _ = pipe.Exec(ctx)
}

	6.	Ack path is good—make it bulletproof.
You do LREM procList 1 payload after success. Keep it. Also emit an event (append-only NDJSON) so your TUI and autopsies don’t have to reconstruct history from Redis:

ledger/events-2025-09-14.ndjson
{"ts": "...", "type": "claim", "worker":"w-07","task":"..."}
{"ts": "...", "type": "done",  "worker":"w-07","task":"...","ms":4123}

	7.	Wire “exactly-once” for handlers.
You built a great idempotency/outbox module—but worker handlers aren’t using it. Before side-effects, check/process via your IdempotencyManager; on success, mark done; on retry, it short-circuits. That turns duplicate replays from “oops” into “no-op”.

Nice-to-haves (soon)
	•	Swap to BLMOVE (Redis ≥6.2) instead of BRPOPLPUSH—same semantics, cleaner future.
	•	Worker registry: When a worker heartbeats, add it to jobqueue:workers (SET). Reaper then iterates that set instead of SCANning the keyspace.
	•	Queue stats: you already have Prom metrics—add inflight{worker=} gauge (len(processing list)) and reaped_total.
	•	Backpressure hook: pause producers when queue_length > N or pending help > M (you’ve got a backpressure controller scaffold—use it).

Verdict

Architecture’s solid. The one real bug is the non-renewing heartbeat; fix that and you’re safe under real load. After that, unify Redis, kill KEYS, add a tiny scheduler, and your “just-for-fun” queue is suddenly the backbone for the SLAPS swarm.

You built the right primitives. Now make them unforgiving.

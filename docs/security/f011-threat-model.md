## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive security threat model for the Automatic Capacity Planning system, identifying potential security risks, attack vectors, and mitigation strategies. The analysis follows the STRIDE methodology (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) and provides actionable security controls.

## System Overview

The Automatic Capacity Planning system uses queueing theory and predictive analytics to automatically scale worker capacity. It processes sensitive operational data, makes scaling decisions that impact infrastructure costs, and has the capability to modify production systems.

### Key Security Concerns
- **High-privilege operations**: System can scale infrastructure autonomously
- **Cost impact**: Malicious scaling decisions could result in significant financial damage
- **Operational data**: Access to queue metrics, worker performance, and business patterns
- **Predictive models**: Forecasting algorithms that could be manipulated
- **Cross-system integration**: Interfaces with Kubernetes, Redis, and monitoring systems

## Assets and Data Classification

### Critical Assets

| Asset | Classification | Impact if Compromised |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|
| Scaling Policies | Confidential | Unauthorized scaling, cost impact |
| Capacity Plans | Internal | Operational disruption, resource waste |
| Worker Metrics | Internal | Performance degradation, insights leak |
| Cost Data | Confidential | Financial information disclosure |
| API Keys & Tokens | Secret | Full system compromise |
| Forecasting Models | Internal | Prediction manipulation, competitive advantage loss |
| Redis Connection Strings | Secret | Data access, queue manipulation |
| Kubernetes RBAC Tokens | Secret | Cluster-wide infrastructure control |

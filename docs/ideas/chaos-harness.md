## Executive Summary
Inject controlled failures (latency, drops, Redis failovers) to test resilience and visualize recovery in the TUI. Automate soak and chaos scenarios with guardrails.

> [!note]- **üó£Ô∏è CLAUDE'S THOUGHTS üí≠**
> Netflix's Chaos Monkey for job queues! This builds MASSIVE confidence. The visual markers on charts during chaos events is brilliant - you can literally watch the system recover. The TTL-based injections are smart - prevents forgotten chaos from destroying prod. Consider adding a "chaos report" that generates a beautiful PDF showing how the system handled various failure modes. Also, "Game Day" mode where teams compete to break each other's configs!

## Motivation
- Validate that retries, DLQ, and backpressure behave under stress.
- Build confidence in failover paths and SLO budgets.
- Catch regressions before they hit production.

## Tech Plan
- Fault injectors:
  - Worker: delays, random failures by rate, panic/restart, partial processing.
  - Redis: optional proxy to inject latency/drops; simulate failover (sentinel/cluster).
  - Admin API: toggles to enable injectors with TTLs and scopes.
- Scenario runner:
  - Define scenarios (duration, patterns) and run/record outcomes.
  - Integrate with Patterned Load Generator for mixed stress.
- TUI:
  - Scenario picker; live status; recovery metrics (backlog drain time, error rate).
  - Visual markers on charts during injections.
- Guardrails:
  - ‚ÄúChaos mode‚Äù banner; require typed confirmation; lock out in prod by policy.

## User Stories + Acceptance Criteria
- As an SRE, I can run a 5‚Äëminute latency+drop scenario in staging and see recovery time and DLQ impact.
- Acceptance:
  - [ ] Worker injectors controllable via Admin API with scopes/TTLs.
  - [ ] Scenario runner orchestrates injectors and records metrics.
  - [ ] TUI surfaces status and recovers settings.

## Definition of Done
Run repeatable chaos scenarios safely in test envs with clear metrics and automatic cleanup.

## Test Plan
- Unit: injector toggles; TTL expiry; metrics collection.
- Integration: end‚Äëto‚Äëend chaos scenario with exporters and recovery tracking.

## Task List
- [ ] Implement worker injectors + API
- [ ] Add Redis proxy hooks (optional)
- [ ] Scenario runner + metrics
- [ ] TUI picker + status
- [ ] Docs + presets

## Claude's Verdict ‚öñÔ∏è

Chaos engineering for job queues is untapped. The visual recovery in TUI is pure gold for building confidence.

### Vibe Check

Gremlin charges $$$$ for chaos testing. Litmus is complex. Built-in chaos with visual feedback? That's innovation.

### Score Card

**Traditional Score:**
- User Value: 7/10 (builds massive confidence)
- Dev Efficiency: 6/10 (injector complexity)
- Risk Profile: 5/10 (dangerous if misused)
- Strategic Fit: 7/10 (reliability differentiator)
- Market Timing: 7/10 (chaos engineering is hot)
- **OFS: 6.55** ‚Üí BUILD SOON

**X-Factor Score:**
- Holy Shit Factor: 7/10 ("Watch it break and recover!")
- Meme Potential: 7/10 (screenshot chaos recovery)
- Flex Appeal: 8/10 ("We chaos test in production")
- FOMO Generator: 6/10 (Netflix vibes)
- Addiction Score: 5/10 (used during game days)
- Shareability: 7/10 (conference talks)
- **X-Factor: 5.9** ‚Üí Strong viral potential

### Conclusion

[üí•]

This is how you build unbreakable systems. The visual recovery alone is worth it. Ship this and run public "break our queue" challenges.

# Producer Backpressure

| Priority | Domain | Dependencies | Risks | LoC Estimate | Complexity | Effort | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Medium‚ÄëHigh | Producer SDK / Flow Control | Admin API stats, client SDKs | Adoption friction, uneven throttling | ~250‚Äì450 | Medium | 5 (Fib) | High |

## Executive Summary
Provide producers with real‚Äëtime backpressure signals and helpers to adapt enqueue rate when queues are saturated. Offer SDK shims that expose `SuggestThrottle()` and circuit breaking by priority.

> [!note]- **üó£Ô∏è CLAUDE'S THOUGHTS üí≠**
> This is brilliant flow control engineering! Backpressure is the difference between resilient systems and cascading failures. The priority-aware shedding is chef's kiss - protecting high-priority payments while throttling bulk emails. The jittered polling prevents thundering herds. Circuit breakers with half-open probing? *Chef's kiss*. This could prevent so many 3am pages. Consider adding exponential backoff on repeated throttles and maybe webhook notifications for ops teams when circuits trip.

## Motivation
- Prevent runaway enqueue that overwhelms workers and downstream systems.
- Encourage smooth traffic shaping without bespoke logic in every producer.
- Improve overall SLO adherence by coordinating producers and workers.

## Tech Plan
- Signals:
  - Poll Admin API stats (backlog length, age, rate limit budget) with jitter.
  - Expose per‚Äëqueue thresholds and target backlog windows.
  - Optional push channel via Event Hooks for threshold crossings.
- SDK helpers (Go first):
  - `BackpressureController` with `SuggestThrottle()` returning sleep/delay hints.
  - Circuit breaker for enqueue (open on sustained saturation; half‚Äëopen probes).
  - Priority‚Äëaware hints (high protected, low sheds first).
- Protocol hints:
  - Include rate/budget headers in API responses when using HTTP Admin API.
- Producer integration:
  - Simple wrapper: `bp.Run(ctx, func() { enqueue(...) })` schedules work to hints.
  - Metrics: observed throttle, shed events, breaker state.

## User Stories + Acceptance Criteria
- As a producer, I can adopt a small helper and see my enqueue smooth under saturation.
- As an SRE, I can see backpressure metrics and confirm fewer DLQs and timeouts.
- Acceptance:
  - [ ] Backpressure controller with thresholds and jittered polling.
  - [ ] Circuit breaker with configurable trip criteria and recovery.
  - [ ] Metrics exported for throttle and shed decisions.

## Definition of Done
Go SDK exposes backpressure helpers; reference examples show smoothing; TUI widget indicates active backpressure.

## Test Plan
- Unit: controller math, jitter, breaker transitions.
- Integration: patterned load showing smoothing vs. baseline.

## Task List
- [ ] Define thresholds and controller
- [ ] Implement Go SDK helper
- [ ] Integrate Admin API hints
- [ ] Add TUI indicator + metrics
- [ ] Docs + examples

## Detailed Design Specification

### Overview

Producer Backpressure transforms reactive panic into proactive control. Instead of systems failing catastrophically when overwhelmed, producers intelligently throttle themselves based on real-time queue health signals. This creates a self-regulating ecosystem where high-priority work flows smoothly while lower-priority tasks gracefully yield resources.

The system works through three coordinated mechanisms: intelligent polling of queue metrics, priority-aware circuit breakers, and SDK helpers that make adoption effortless. The result is a queue that breathes under load rather than suffocating.

### TUI Design

#### Desktop View (Large Resolution)
![Producer Backpressure Desktop View](../images/producer-backpressure-desktop.svg)

The desktop view provides comprehensive visibility into backpressure operations through a three-panel layout. The left panel shows queue health with visual indicators for backlog depth, throttling status, and circuit breaker states. The center panel displays real-time analytics including throttle rates over time and producer response metrics. The right panel offers manual controls and configuration options for emergency overrides.

#### Mobile View (Small Resolution)
![Producer Backpressure Mobile View](../images/producer-backpressure-mobile.svg)

The mobile view stacks information vertically with tabbed navigation for space efficiency. Each tab focuses on essential information: Status shows current system health, Charts display throttling trends, Controls provide manual overrides, and Config manages thresholds and timing parameters.

### Backpressure Control Algorithm

#### Threshold-Based Flow Control

The system maintains target backlog windows for each priority level:

```go
type BacklogThresholds struct {
    HighPriority   BacklogWindow `json:"high_priority"`
    MediumPriority BacklogWindow `json:"medium_priority"`
    LowPriority    BacklogWindow `json:"low_priority"`
}

type BacklogWindow struct {
    Green  int `json:"green_max"`   // 0-500: no throttling
    Yellow int `json:"yellow_max"`  // 501-2000: light throttling
    Red    int `json:"red_max"`     // 2001+: heavy throttling/shedding
}
```

#### Adaptive Throttling Algorithm

Throttling recommendations adapt to queue pressure:

```go
func (bp *BackpressureController) SuggestThrottle(priority Priority) time.Duration {
    window := bp.getBacklogWindow(priority)
    current := bp.getCurrentBacklog(priority)

    switch {
    case current <= window.Green:
        return 0 // No throttling needed
    case current <= window.Yellow:
        // Light throttling: 10ms to 500ms based on position in window
        ratio := float64(current-window.Green) / float64(window.Yellow-window.Green)
        return time.Duration(10 + 490*ratio) * time.Millisecond
    default:
        // Heavy throttling: 500ms to 5s, with shedding for low priority
        ratio := math.Min(1.0, float64(current-window.Yellow)/float64(window.Red-window.Yellow))
        baseDelay := time.Duration(500+4500*ratio) * time.Millisecond

        // Apply priority scaling
        switch priority {
        case HighPriority:
            return baseDelay * 50 / 100  // 50% of base delay
        case MediumPriority:
            return baseDelay             // Full delay
        case LowPriority:
            if ratio > 0.8 {
                return InfiniteDelay // Shed low priority work
            }
            return baseDelay * 150 / 100 // 150% of base delay
        }
    }
}
```

#### Circuit Breaker Implementation

Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures during extreme load:

```go
type CircuitBreaker struct {
    State           CircuitState
    FailureCount    int
    LastFailureTime time.Time
    SuccessCount    int
    Config          CircuitConfig
}

type CircuitConfig struct {
    FailureThreshold    int           // Trip after N failures
    RecoveryThreshold   int           // Close after N successes
    TripWindow         time.Duration  // Time window for failure counting
    RecoveryTimeout    time.Duration  // Wait before half-open
    ProbeInterval      time.Duration  // Half-open probe frequency
}

func (cb *CircuitBreaker) ShouldAllow() bool {
    switch cb.State {
    case Closed:
        return true
    case Open:
        if time.Since(cb.LastFailureTime) > cb.Config.RecoveryTimeout {
            cb.State = HalfOpen
            return true // Allow probe request
        }
        return false
    case HalfOpen:
        return time.Since(cb.lastProbe) > cb.Config.ProbeInterval
    }
}
```

### SDK Integration Patterns

#### Basic Throttling Wrapper

```go
// Simple wrapper for automatic throttling
func (bp *BackpressureController) Run(ctx context.Context, priority Priority, work func()) error {
    delay := bp.SuggestThrottle(priority)
    if delay == InfiniteDelay {
        bp.metrics.IncShedEvents(priority)
        return ErrJobShed
    }

    if delay > 0 {
        select {
        case <-time.After(delay):
        case <-ctx.Done():
            return ctx.Err()
        }
    }

    work()
    return nil
}

// Usage
bp.Run(ctx, MediumPriority, func() {
    client.Enqueue("email-queue", emailPayload)
})
```

#### Batch Processing Integration

```go
// Batch processor with backpressure awareness
func (bp *BackpressureController) ProcessBatch(ctx context.Context, jobs []Job) error {
    for _, job := range jobs {
        if err := bp.Run(ctx, job.Priority, func() {
            client.Enqueue(job.Queue, job.Payload)
        }); err != nil {
            if err == ErrJobShed {
                bp.requeueForLater(job)
                continue
            }
            return err
        }
    }
    return nil
}
```

### Priority-Based Shedding Strategy

The system implements intelligent load shedding that preserves critical workflows:

1. **High Priority** (Payments, Auth, Critical API): Never shed, minimal throttling
2. **Medium Priority** (User notifications, Reports): Throttle but don't shed
3. **Low Priority** (Batch operations, Analytics): Aggressive throttling, shed when necessary

### Performance Considerations

#### Polling Strategy

- **Jittered Intervals**: Base 5-second polling with ¬±1 second jitter prevents thundering herd
- **Exponential Backoff**: Failed polls back off exponentially up to 60 seconds
- **Batch Efficiency**: Single API call retrieves stats for all queues
- **Local Caching**: Throttle recommendations cached for up to 30 seconds

#### Memory and CPU Impact

- **Minimal Overhead**: ~50KB memory per BackpressureController
- **CPU Usage**: <0.1% CPU for typical workloads
- **Network**: 1 API call per 5 seconds (configurable)
- **Latency**: Sub-millisecond throttle decision time

### Monitoring and Observability

#### Key Metrics

```go
type BackpressureMetrics struct {
    ThrottleEventsTotal    *prometheus.CounterVec   // By priority, queue
    ShedEventsTotal        *prometheus.CounterVec   // By priority, queue
    ThrottleDelayHistogram *prometheus.HistogramVec // Delay distributions
    CircuitBreakerState    *prometheus.GaugeVec     // Current states
    QueueBacklogGauge      *prometheus.GaugeVec     // Current backlog sizes
    ProducerCompliance     *prometheus.GaugeVec     // Throttle compliance %
}
```

#### Alerting Rules

```yaml
groups:
- name: backpressure_alerts
  rules:
  - alert: CircuitBreakerTripped
    expr: circuit_breaker_state > 0
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Circuit breaker tripped for {{ $labels.queue }}"

  - alert: HighShedRate
    expr: rate(shed_events_total[5m]) > 10
    for: 2m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "High job shed rate: {{ $value }} jobs/sec"
```

### Failure Modes and Recovery

#### Common Failure Scenarios

1. **Admin API Unavailable**: Fall back to last known good values with gradual degradation
2. **Network Partitions**: Circuit breakers provide immediate protection
3. **Incorrect Thresholds**: Manual override controls allow emergency adjustments
4. **Producer Non-Compliance**: Metrics track and alert on poor compliance rates

#### Recovery Strategies

```go
type RecoveryStrategy struct {
    FallbackMode     bool          // Use cached values when API unavailable
    GracefulDegrade  time.Duration // Gradually relax throttling during outages
    ManualOverride   bool          // Allow ops to disable backpressure
    EmergencyMode    bool          // Disable all throttling in emergencies
}
```

### Security Considerations

- **Rate Limit API Calls**: Prevent backpressure system from overwhelming Admin API
- **Authentication**: Secure polling credentials with rotation support
- **Audit Logging**: Track all manual overrides and configuration changes
- **Least Privilege**: Separate read-only credentials for backpressure polling

### Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning**: Predictive throttling based on historical patterns
- **Cross-Region Backpressure**: Coordinate throttling across multiple data centers
- **Application-Aware Policies**: Throttling rules based on business logic
- **Integration Webhooks**: Real-time notifications to external systems
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Auto-adjust thresholds based on worker capacity
- **Cost-Based Prioritization**: Factor in processing costs for throttling decisions

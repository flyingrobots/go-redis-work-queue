## Executive Summary
An in‚ÄëTUI JSON editor to author, validate, and enqueue job payloads. Includes templates, snippets, schema validation, scheduling (run‚Äëat/cron), and pretty diff/peek integration for rapid iteration.

> [!note]- **üó£Ô∏è CLAUDE'S THOUGHTS üí≠**
> YES! This is Postman for job queues. The template system with snippets is brilliant - imagine `{{now()}}`, `{{uuid()}}`, `{{faker.name()}}`. Schema validation prevents those 3am "wrong payload format" incidents. The cron scheduling is killer for recurring jobs. Consider adding a "test run" mode that enqueues to a sandbox queue. Also, payload history would be clutch - "use payload from 3 runs ago".

## Motivation
- Speed up development and debugging by removing context switches to external editors and scripts.
- Promote consistent payloads with reusable templates and schema hints.
- Enable safe scheduled submissions for backfills and recurring work.

## Tech Plan
- Editor: textinput/viewport hybrid with syntax highlight (lightweight), bracket matching, and JSON linting.
- Templates: load from `config/templates/*.json` or inline; snippet expansion (e.g., `now()`, `uuid()`).
- Validation: optional JSON Schema (draft 7) validation per queue/template; show errors inline.
- Enqueue: `e` submits to selected queue; `E` opens count + schedule options (run‚Äëat ISO8601, optional cron spec).
- Safety: size/field caps; strip secrets from UI logs; confirm in non‚Äëtest envs.
- Integration: peek last enqueued sample; diff between current editor buffer and last run.

## User Stories + Acceptance Criteria
- As a developer, I can open a template, edit, validate, and enqueue with one keystroke.
- As an SRE, I can schedule a safe backfill at off‚Äëpeak with guardrails.
- As a reviewer, I can see a redacted preview and confirm before enqueuing to prod.
- Acceptance:
  - [ ] JSON lint and schema errors highlighted with line/col.
  - [ ] Template list with fuzzy search and quick preview.
  - [ ] Enqueue supports count, priority, delay/run‚Äëat, and optional cron.
  - [ ] Diff/peek integration shows exactly what was sent.

## Definition of Done
Editor with templates, validation, and enqueue/schedule flow; docs with examples and safeguards; updated help overlay.

## Test Plan
- Unit: schema validation adapter, snippet expansion, schedule parser.
- Integration: enqueue to test queue with varying sizes; error handling.
- UX: manual runs to verify keybindings and guardrails.

## Task List
- [ ] Implement editor widget + linting
- [ ] Template loader + snippets
- [ ] Schema validation + error UI
- [ ] Enqueue + schedule flow
- [ ] Diff/peek integration
- [ ] Docs + screenshots

### Advanced Features

#### 1. Smart Templates

Templates are more than static JSON files - they're intelligent starting points:

```json
{
  "name": "user_signup",
  "description": "New user registration template",
  "category": "user",
  "schema": "schemas/user_signup.json",
  "defaults": {
    "priority": 5,
    "retry_count": 3
  },
  "payload": {
    "type": "user_signup",
    "user": {
      "email": "{{input:email}}",
      "name": "{{input:name}}",
      "plan": "{{select:free,pro,premium}}"
    },
    "timestamp": "{{now()}}",
    "request_id": "{{uuid()}}"
  },
  "variables": {
    "email": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "email",
      "description": "User's email address"
    }
  }
}
```

Features:
- **Input prompts**: `{{input:field}}` triggers a modal for user input
- **Select lists**: `{{select:opt1,opt2}}` shows a dropdown
- **Conditional fields**: Show/hide based on other values
- **Validation rules**: Per-field validation beyond schema
- **Default values**: Smart defaults based on context

#### 2. Schema-Driven Intelligence

The editor becomes context-aware through JSON Schema integration:

- **Autocomplete**: Suggests valid keys and values based on schema
- **Type coercion**: Automatically quotes strings, validates numbers
- **Enum hints**: Shows allowed values for enum fields
- **Required fields**: Highlights missing required properties
- **Format validation**: Checks emails, URLs, dates, UUIDs
- **Custom validators**: Regex patterns, min/max constraints

#### 3. Snippet System

Dynamic snippets that execute at enqueue time:

**Built-in Functions**:
- `{{now()}}` - Current ISO 8601 timestamp
- `{{now(+1h)}}` - Timestamp with offset
- `{{uuid()}}` - Generate UUID v4
- `{{random(min, max)}}` - Random number
- `{{sequence()}}` - Auto-incrementing counter
- `{{env.VAR_NAME}}` - Environment variable

**Faker Integration**:
- `{{faker.name()}}` - Random full name
- `{{faker.email()}}` - Valid email address
- `{{faker.phone()}}` - Phone number
- `{{faker.company()}}` - Company name
- `{{faker.address()}}` - Street address
- `{{faker.lorem(20)}}` - Lorem ipsum text

**Custom Snippets**:
Users can define custom snippets in `~/.queue-studio/snippets.json`:
```json
{
  "customer_id": "cust_{{random(10000, 99999)}}",
  "api_version": "2024-01-01",
  "region": "{{env.AWS_REGION:-us-east-1}}"
}
```

#### 4. Visual Scheduling

The scheduling interface makes complex schedules intuitive:

**Immediate Mode**: Default, enqueues right away

**Delayed Mode**: Visual time picker
- Relative: "in 5 minutes", "in 2 hours"
- Absolute: Calendar and time picker
- Natural language: "tomorrow at 3pm"

**Cron Mode**: Visual cron builder
- Preset patterns: hourly, daily, weekly, monthly
- Visual builder with dropdowns
- Cron expression preview
- Next 5 run times displayed

**Batch Mode**: Multiple jobs with variations
- Count: Number of jobs to create
- Delay between: Stagger job creation
- Variable injection: Increment counters, vary data

#### 5. Test Mode

Safe testing without affecting production:

- **Dry Run**: Validates without enqueueing
- **Sandbox Queue**: Enqueue to test queue
- **Simulation**: Shows what would happen
- **Diff Preview**: Compare against last successful run
- **Metrics Preview**: Estimated impact on queue

#### 6. Safety Features

Protecting against common mistakes:

- **PII Detection**: Warns about potential sensitive data
- **Size Limits**: Prevents payloads over threshold
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents accidental job bombs
- **Environment Warnings**: Red borders in production
- **Undo/Redo**: Full edit history with Ctrl+Z/Y
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: For large batches or production

### Technical Implementation

#### Architecture

```go
type Studio struct {
    Editor      *JSONEditor
    Templates   *TemplateManager
    Validator   *SchemaValidator
    Snippets    *SnippetEngine
    History     *JobHistory
    Scheduler   *JobScheduler
}

type JSONEditor struct {
    Buffer      *TextBuffer
    Syntax      *SyntaxHighlighter
    Linter      *JSONLinter
    Completion  *AutoCompleter
    Cursor      CursorPosition
    Selection   *Selection
}

type Template struct {
    Name        string
    Category    string
    Schema      *jsonschema.Schema
    Payload     json.RawMessage
    Variables   map[string]Variable
    Defaults    map[string]interface{}
}
```

#### Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Templates and schemas loaded on demand
- **Incremental Validation**: Only revalidate changed portions
- **Debounced Linting**: 200ms delay after typing stops
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Handle large JSON files efficiently
- **Snippet Caching**: Pre-compute common snippet values
- **Background Saving**: Auto-save drafts without blocking

#### Storage

```yaml
# ~/.queue-studio/config.yaml
templates_dir: ~/.queue-studio/templates/
history_limit: 100
auto_save: true
auto_save_interval: 30s
theme: tokyo-night

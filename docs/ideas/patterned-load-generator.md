# Patterned Load Generator

| Priority | Domain | Dependencies | Risks | LoC Estimate | Complexity | Effort | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Medium | Bench/Load | Existing bench plumbing | Overloading env, noisy graphs | ~200‚Äì350 | Medium (per tick O(1)) | 3 (Fib) | Medium |

## Executive Summary
Extend the bench tool to support sine/burst/ramp patterns, with guardrails and live visualization.

> [!note]- **üó£Ô∏è CLAUDE'S THOUGHTS üí≠**
> Smart evolution of your existing bench tool! Sine waves for daily traffic, bursts for Black Friday, ramps for gradual rollouts. This is how you validate your circuit breaker and rate limiter in realistic scenarios. The profile save/load is clutch for CI/CD integration. Consider adding a "chaos" pattern that randomly switches between patterns - great for finding edge cases.

## Motivation
Validate behavior under realistic traffic and create great demos.

## Tech Plan
- Implement pattern generators; controls for duration/amplitude; guardrails (max rate/total).
- Overlay target vs actual enqueue rate on charts; profile persistence optional.

## User Stories + Acceptance Criteria
- As a tester, I can run predefined patterns and see accurate live charts.
- Acceptance:
  - [ ] Sine, burst, ramp patterns; cancel/stop supported.
  - [ ] Guardrails prevent runaway load.
  - [ ] Saved profiles can be reloaded.

## Definition of Done
Patterns implemented with charts; docs include examples and cautions.

## Test Plan
- Unit: pattern math; guardrails.
- Manual: visualize and compare patterns; cancellation behavior.

## Task List
- [ ] Implement sine/burst/ramp
- [ ] Add controls + guardrails
- [ ] Chart overlay target vs actual
- [ ] Save/load profiles

## Claude's Verdict ‚öñÔ∏è

Practical feature that makes testing actually useful. This turns your queue from a toy into a battle-tested system. Plus, the demo potential is huge.

### Vibe Check

K6 has this for HTTP. JMeter has it for everything. But having it built into your queue's TUI? That's convenience. Gatling would approve.

### Score Card

**Traditional Score:**
- User Value: 6/10 (mainly for testing/validation)
- Dev Efficiency: 8/10 (1 week, extends existing code)
- Risk Profile: 8/10 (low risk, well-contained)
- Strategic Fit: 6/10 (supports quality, not core)
- Market Timing: 5/10 (nice to have)
- **OFS: 6.45** ‚Üí BUILD SOON

**X-Factor Score:**
- Holy Shit Factor: 4/10 ("Oh, realistic load patterns")
- Meme Potential: 5/10 (screenshot sine wave crushing system)
- Flex Appeal: 5/10 ("We test with production patterns")
- FOMO Generator: 3/10 (expected in serious tools)
- Addiction Score: 4/10 (used during testing cycles)
- Shareability: 4/10 (mentioned in testing docs)
- **X-Factor: 3.2** ‚Üí Low viral potential

### Conclusion

[üëç]

Solid engineering hygiene. Not glamorous, but the kind of feature that prevents 3am pages. The 3 Fib effort makes this a no-brainer quick win. Ship it and sleep better.

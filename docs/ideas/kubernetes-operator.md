# Kubernetes Operator

| Priority | Domain | Dependencies | Risks | LoC Estimate | Complexity | Effort | Impact |

## Executive Summary
Ship a Kubernetes Operator with CRDs to declaratively manage queues and workers. Reconcile desired state (workers, rate limits, DLQ policies) from YAML, autoscale by backlog/SLA targets, and support safe rolling deploys and preemption policies.

> [!note]- **üó£Ô∏è CLAUDE'S THOUGHTS üí≠**
> THIS is how you become Kubernetes-native! CRDs are the new API. Autoscaling based on queue depth is what KEDA does, but built-in? Game changer. The GitOps story writes itself. Be careful with the reconciliation loops - they can spiral. The drain hooks during rolling updates show you understand production. This unlocks the entire K8s ecosystem - ArgoCD, Flux, Helm. Consider adding a Grafana dashboard that ships with the operator!

## Motivation
- GitOps‚Äëfriendly operations for the queue stack.
- Autoscale workers based on backlog growth and latency SLOs.
- Consistent, reviewed changes across environments.

## Tech Plan
- CRDs:
  - `Queue`: name, priorities, rate limits, DLQ config, retention.
  - `WorkerPool`: image, version, env, resources, concurrency, max in‚Äëflight, drain policy, min/max replicas.
  - `Policy`: global knobs (circuit breaker thresholds, retry/backoff defaults).
- Reconciliation:
  - Manage Deployments/StatefulSets for workers; inject config/secret mounts.
  - Observe metrics (backlog length, p95 latency) and scale `WorkerPool` via HPA‚Äëlike logic.
  - Orchestrate rolling updates with drain/ready hooks via Admin API.
- Safety & RBAC:
  - Namespace‚Äëscoped by default; cluster‚Äëscoped optional.
  - Webhooks: CRD validation (limits, reserved names), defaulting, and drift detection.
  - Finalizers to drain on delete; prevent orphaned DLQs.
- Observability:
  - Conditions per resource; events; Prometheus metrics (reconcile durations, errors).
- Tooling:
  - Kustomize bases for common setups; examples repo.

## User Stories + Acceptance Criteria
- As a platform engineer, I can declare a `WorkerPool` and see it reconcile with autoscaling.
- As an SRE, I can update a `Queue` rate limit and see changes propagate safely.
- Acceptance:
  - [ ] CRDs with schemas and validation webhooks.
  - [ ] Reconciler manages Deployments and scales by backlog/SLO.
  - [ ] Rolling updates drain before restart.

## Definition of Done
Operator reconciles Queue/WorkerPool with autoscaling and safe rolling updates; docs include CRD specs and examples; e2e tests pass on kind.

## Test Plan
- Unit: reconcilers (table‚Äëdriven), webhooks.
- E2E: kind cluster with fake workload; autoscale under patterned load; upgrade tests.

## Task List
- [ ] Define CRDs + validation webhooks
- [ ] Implement reconcilers (Queue, WorkerPool)
- [ ] Autoscaling logic (backlog/SLO)
- [ ] Rolling update hooks (drain/ready)
- [ ] Examples + CI e2e

## Claude's Verdict ‚öñÔ∏è

Kubernetes Operator is table stakes for cloud-native adoption. This unlocks enterprise deployments.

### Vibe Check

Every serious infrastructure tool has an operator now. RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis all have them. Yours with queue-aware autoscaling? That's next level.

### Score Card

**Traditional Score:**
- User Value: 9/10 (GitOps nirvana)
- Dev Efficiency: 3/10 (complex, lots of edge cases)
- Risk Profile: 5/10 (reconciliation loops are tricky)
- Strategic Fit: 9/10 (enterprise requirement)
- Market Timing: 8/10 (K8s is everywhere)
- **OFS: 7.05** ‚Üí BUILD SOON

**X-Factor Score:**
- Holy Shit Factor: 5/10 (expected for K8s tools)
- Meme Potential: 3/10 (CRDs aren't sexy)
- Flex Appeal: 8/10 ("Full K8s native")
- FOMO Generator: 7/10 (competitors will need this)
- Addiction Score: 7/10 (GitOps is addictive)
- Shareability: 5/10 (mentioned in K8s talks)
- **X-Factor: 4.9** ‚Üí Moderate viral potential

### Conclusion

[‚ò∏Ô∏è]

Not sexy but absolutely necessary for Kubernetes shops. The autoscaling based on queue metrics is your differentiator. Ship this to unlock enterprise.

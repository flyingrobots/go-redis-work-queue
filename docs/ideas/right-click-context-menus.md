# Right‚Äëclick Context Menus

| Priority | Domain | Dependencies | Risks | LoC Estimate | Complexity | Effort | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Medium | TUI UX | `bubblezone` hitboxes, action registry, overlays | Destructive misclicks, discoverability | ~250‚Äì400 | Medium | 3 (Fib) | Medium‚ÄëHigh |

## Executive Summary
Add contextual menus on right‚Äëclick (and `m`) across the TUI to expose actions where users are looking: peek, requeue, purge (confirmed), copy payload/key, open trace, export sample. Menus appear adjacent to the cursor with precise hitboxes and keyboard fallbacks.

> [!note]- **üó£Ô∏è CLAUDE'S THOUGHTS üí≠**
> THIS is how you make terminal apps feel modern! Right-click is muscle memory for everyone. The bubblezone integration for precise hitboxes is crucial - nothing worse than clicking the wrong row. Consider adding copy-paste actions (copy job ID, copy payload JSON). Also, a "Send to..." submenu that integrates with other tools would be killer. Make sure the menus are FAST - any lag kills the magic.

## Motivation
- Speed common actions and reduce cognitive load.
- Surface advanced operations without cluttering primary views.
- Improve mouse UX to match keyboard parity.

## Tech Plan
- Hitboxes: integrate `bubblezone` to register zones for tabs, table rows, charts, and info regions.
- Menu widget: lightweight overlay with items, accelerators, and disabled states; auto‚Äëpositions within viewport.
- Action registry: map context (e.g., queue row, DLQ item) to available actions with capability checks.
- Safety: destructive items require confirm modal; show exact scope (e.g., ‚ÄúPurge DLQ dead_letter (123 items)‚Äù).
- Keyboard parity: `m` opens context menu for the focused item; arrow/enter to select.
- Extensibility: plug new actions via registry to avoid scattering logic.

## User Stories + Acceptance Criteria
- As a user, I can right‚Äëclick a queue row and choose Peek or Enqueue.
- As an operator, I can right‚Äëclick DLQ items and Requeue/Purge with confirmation.
- Acceptance:
  - [ ] Precise hitboxes with `bubblezone` on rows/tabs.
  - [ ] Context menu overlays with keyboard + mouse interaction.
  - [ ] Destructive actions gated with explicit confirmation.

## Definition of Done
Context menus enabled on Job Queue and DLQ tabs with essential actions and confirmations; help overlay updated with hints.

## Test Plan
- Unit: action resolution given context; confirm flows.
- Manual: mouse targeting accuracy; menu positioning at edges; keyboard fallback.

## Task List
- [ ] Integrate `bubblezone` and register zones
- [ ] Build menu overlay component
- [ ] Implement action registry + confirm hooks
- [ ] Wire menus in Queues + DLQ
- [ ] Update help/docs

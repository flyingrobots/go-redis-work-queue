# F002: Comprehensive TUI Redesign - Mobile-First Queue Interface

## Executive Summary

This document presents a complete redesign of the Redis Work Queue TUI, implementing a **mobile-first responsive design philosophy** for terminal interfaces. The redesign incorporates all 32+ features from the ideas directory while addressing the core challenges of information density, navigation efficiency, and cross-device usability in terminal environments.

### Key Innovation: Terminal Breakpoints

Just like responsive web design, this TUI adapts to terminal size with defined breakpoints:

- **Mobile (≤40 cols)**: Stack panels vertically, minimal chrome
- **Tablet (41-80 cols)**: Two-column layouts, compact headers
- **Desktop (81-120 cols)**: Multi-panel layouts, full feature set
- **Ultrawide (121+ cols)**: Side-by-side multi-view, dashboard mode

## Design Philosophy

### 1. Information Density Gradients
Information complexity scales with available space - more room means more detail, less room means focused essentials.

### 2. Progressive Enhancement
Features are layered based on terminal capabilities and space:
- Base: Core functionality works everywhere
- Enhanced: Rich visuals for capable terminals
- Premium: Advanced features for desktop-class terminals

### 3. Gesture-First Navigation
Mouse, keyboard, and (future) voice commands all feel natural:
- Click/tap for selection
- Swipe gestures in mobile mode
- Keyboard shortcuts scale with available space
- Voice commands for accessibility

## System Architecture

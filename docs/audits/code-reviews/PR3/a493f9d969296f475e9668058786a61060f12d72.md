## CODE REVIEW FEEDBACK

> How to use: copy one of the fenced templates above, paste under each feedback item, and replace all `{placeholders}`.

The following section contains the feedback items, extracted from the code review linked above. Please read each item and respond with your decision by injecting one of the two above templates beneath the feedback item.

### CODEOWNERS: remove redundant pattern entries

- In .github/CODEOWNERS, redundant entries duplicate the top-level wildcard `* @flyingrobots`. Keep the wildcard default owner and remove unnecessary pattern entries unless specific overrides are required.

### Changelog workflow: quote GOPATH binary path

- In .github/workflows/changelog.yml, ensure the git-chglog invocation uses a quoted `"$(go env GOPATH)"/bin/...` to avoid word-splitting issues.

### Changelog workflow: serialize runs via concurrency

- Add a top-level `concurrency:` block to .github/workflows/changelog.yml to prevent concurrent runs from colliding on pushes to the default branch.

### CI: gate E2E with Redis readiness

- In .github/workflows/ci.yml, add a readiness check for Redis before starting E2E loops against localhost:6379 to avoid flakiness.

### GoReleaser: robust env writes and multi-arch setup

- In .github/workflows/goreleaser.yml, quote `$GITHUB_ENV` redirections and set up QEMU + Docker Buildx before multi-arch image builds.

### Markdownlint: compact branch array and least-privilege

- In .github/workflows/markdownlint.yml, use `branches: [main]` (no spaces), add a minimal `permissions:` block, and serialize runs with `concurrency`.

### Markdownlint: pin action versions to SHAs

- Pin actions/checkout and markdownlint-cli2-action to specific commit SHAs for supply-chain safety.

### Update-progress workflow: YAML and safety hardening

- In .github/workflows/update-progress.yml, ensure minimal permissions, guard against self-trigger loops, and consider concurrency to avoid redundant runs.

### GoReleaser config: reproducible artifacts and owner/name templating

- In .goreleaser.yaml, prefer deterministic archive naming and use templated owner/name values; remove stray trailing blank lines.

### Markdownlint config: avoid global MD013 disable

- In .markdownlint.yaml, avoid disabling MD013 repo-wide; rely on per-file overrides where necessary.

### create_postmortem_tasks.py:117

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In create_postmortem_tasks.py around lines 114 to 117, the two os.makedirs calls
use exist_ok=True but lack error handling; wrap each directory creation in a
try/except that catches OSError, detect and handle permission/readonly errors
(e.g. errno.EACCES, errno.EROFS) and any other OS-level failures, and on error
either log a clear message with the path and errno/details and exit with a
non-zero status or re-raise a new exception with contextual information so the
script fails loudly rather than silently.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 8 | Added explicit error handling so directory creation fails fast with actionable context. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Even simple scripts benefit from surfacing permission/readonly issues explicitly instead of relying on `exist_ok`.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Wrapped the `os.makedirs` calls in a helper that catches `OSError`, maps EACCES/EROFS to descriptive messages, and exits non-zero on failure.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> The helper raises a `RuntimeError` that propagates through the script and is printed to stderr before exiting.
>
> ## Notes
>
> None.

### demos/lipgloss-transformation.tape:278

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In demos/lipgloss-transformation.tape lines 1–278, the demo invokes a
nonexistent ./bin/queue-tui --enhanced; update the tape to run the actual
entrypoint instead (replace the "./bin/queue-tui --enhanced" line with either a
build+run sequence "go build -o bin/queue-tui ./cmd/tui && ./bin/queue-tui" or a
direct run "go run ./cmd/tui" and remove the unsupported "--enhanced" flag), or
alternatively implement and document a matching --enhanced CLI flag in
cmd/tui/main.go that toggles the enhanced view; pick one approach and make the
corresponding change so the demo invocation runs successfully.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 9 | Updated the VHS tape to invoke the actual TUI binary and removed the unsupported flag. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Demos should mirror real entrypoints; placeholder flags quickly go stale.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Swapped the scripted command to check for `./bin/tui` and run it with the sample config, dropping the nonexistent `--enhanced` flag.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> Keeping the demo tied to the canonical binary ensures future flag changes show up in one place.
>
> ## Notes
>
> None.

```text
In deploy/deploy/data/test.txt lines 1-1 the test data is incorrectly placed
under deploy/deploy; move the file into a Go-style testdata directory such as
testdata/producer/input.ndjson, update any source references, tests, and
CI/deploy manifests to point to the new path, and perform the move as a tracked
rename in git so history is preserved.

```text
In deploy/deploy/data/test.txt around lines 1 to 1, the file contains only the
useless line "test file for producer"; replace it with a deterministic NDJSON
fixture representing a real job payload (one JSON object per line) used by the
producer tests. Construct a minimal, valid payload including required fields
(e.g., id, type, payload data, timestamps, and any flags the consumer expects),
ensure values are deterministic (static IDs/timestamps), and save as NDJSON so
each test run consumes identical input for reproducible assertions.

### deploy/grafana/dashboards/work-queue.json:37

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In deploy/grafana/dashboards/work-queue.json lines 1-37, the dashboard currently
only defines five panels and lacks operational essentials: add a top-level
"time" range object (e.g., from/to defaults such as now-1h/now) so users can
change window; add a "templating" block with query variables for queue, worker,
and environment (using label_values on relevant metrics) so panels can be
filtered; add an "annotations" block to surface deployments and incidents
(Prometheus expressions such as changes(build_info[...])); convert key panels
(queue length, job failure rate, circuit breaker state) to include alerting
rules with sensible thresholds, evaluation window and for/conditions and add
panel threshold visualization and reduceOptions as needed; and add SLO-focused
panels (error budget burn rate, availability over time, SLO target lines) and an
availability/alerts panel tied to SLO thresholds. Ensure all added fields follow
Grafana dashboard JSON schema and reference the Prometheus datasource/metric
labels used elsewhere in this file.

### deployments/admin-api/Dockerfile:18

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In deployments/admin-api/Dockerfile around lines 16 to 18, the go build
invocation doesn't strip debug symbols, set a version variable, or trim paths
for reproducible, smaller binaries; change the build step to accept a VERSION
build-arg (ARG VERSION), add -trimpath and -ldflags '-s -w -X
main.version=${VERSION}' to the go build command (keeping CGO_ENABLED=0
GOOS=linux), so the produced admin-api binary is stripped, has embedded version
metadata, and uses reproducible paths.

### deployments/admin-api/Dockerfile:23

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In deployments/admin-api/Dockerfile around lines 20 to 23, the image currently
uses unpinned alpine:latest and runs as root; change to a specific, pinned
Alpine version (e.g., alpine:3.18 or a project-approved tag) and create a
non-root user/group before switching to it: install packages as root, create a
dedicated user and group, create and set ownership of any workdir/home, drop
privileges with USER <username>, and ensure file permissions are set so the
container does not run as root at runtime.
```

### deployments/admin-api/Dockerfile:31

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In deployments/admin-api/Dockerfile around lines 26 to 31, the Dockerfile
currently copies an environment-specific config into the image (COPY
--from=builder /app/configs/admin-api.yaml ./configs/); remove that COPY so
environment-specific configs are not baked into the image and instead rely on
runtime mounting (volume/ConfigMap/Secret). Update the Dockerfile to stop
copying configs, ensure the image expects configs at a runtime path (e.g.,
./configs/) and add a brief comment indicating configs must be mounted at
runtime via your deployment manifests.
```

### deployments/docker/Dockerfile.admin-api:21

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In deployments/docker/Dockerfile.admin-api around lines 20-21, the Go build
command should strip debug info, embed a version, and make builds reproducible;
change the build to add -trimpath and -ldflags (e.g. -ldflags "-s -w -buildid=
-X main.version=${VERSION}") to bake in version and remove symbol tables, then
run strip on the resulting binary (or use 'go build' with -ldflags "-s -w" and
follow with 'strip admin-api') so the image is smaller and builds are
reproducible; ensure VERSION is provided via build-arg or environment.

### deployments/docker/Dockerfile.admin-api:40

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In deployments/docker/Dockerfile.admin-api around lines 38-40, the COPY line
assumes /app/configs/admin-api.yaml exists in the builder stage which makes the
build fail when it’s absent; fix by guaranteeing the file always exists in the
builder stage (add a step in the builder stage to mkdir -p /app/configs and
create a default admin-api.yaml if missing, or copy a repository default config
into that path) so the final-stage COPY is deterministic and never errors.

```text
In docs/03_milestones.md around lines 11-13 (and similarly at lines 46-51), the
table-of-contents uses the incorrect anchor `#gono-go-decision-gates`; update
those links to the correct slug `#go-no-go-decision-gates` (and search the file
for any other occurrences of `gono-go` to replace) so the ToC links point to the
actual section anchor.

### docs/12_performance_baseline.md:45

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In docs/12_performance_baseline.md around lines 41 to 45, the benchmark example
lacks test environment details making the numbers meaningless; update the doc to
specify the hardware (CPU model, core count, RAM), Redis version and config used
(persistence, maxmemory, eviction, TCP settings), and payload characteristics
(size, serialization) and show a revised example command including a
--bench-payload-size flag (e.g., 1024) plus an accompanying short note listing
the exact hardware and Redis configuration used for the reported results.

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In docs/api/anomaly-radar-slo-budget.md around lines 1–15, add a "Versioning &
Deprecation" section that declares supported API versions (e.g., v1), the
compatibility guarantees (minor/patch compatibility, no silent breaking
changes), the breaking-change policy (how breaking changes are evaluated and
approved), the deprecation timeline (minimum 90 days notice before removal), the
changelog/release process (where changes are recorded and how releases are
communicated), and concise migration guidance for clients (examples of typical
migration steps and links to relevant types like SLOConfig, BurnRateThresholds,
AnomalyThresholds, Alert, MetricSnapshot); also add the same section to the
central API docs file (docs/api/_index.md or the repository’s central API docs
entry) so the policy is discoverable project-wide, and ensure any references to
routes (internal/anomaly-radar-slo-budget/handlers.go RegisterRoutes) and types
are linked or cross-referenced for implementer guidance.

```text
In docs/api/anomaly-radar-slo-budget.md around lines 36 to 38, the docs instruct
users to import an internal package path which is not accessible to consumers;
update the documentation to point to the public exported package path (the
module's published import path for the anomaly-radar-slo-budget package), ensure
the package is exported (move/rename from internal if necessary or add a public
wrapper package), and replace the internal import line with the correct public
import path that consumers can use.

- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In docs/api/anomaly-radar-slo-budget.md around lines 51 to 58, the docs present
two conflicting collector APIs (closures-based SimpleMetricsCollector and an
interface-based QueueMetricsCollector); remove the closures-based
SimpleMetricsCollector snippet and keep the interface-based approach, add an
explicit MetricCollector interface signature description immediately before the
QueueMetricsCollector example so readers see the expected methods and types;
repeat the same cleanup for the other occurrence around lines 446–470 by
deleting the closure example and ensuring the interface signature is documented
prior to the QueueMetricsCollector sample.

In docs/api/anomaly-radar-slo-budget.md around lines 81 to 89, the SLOConfig
struct references BurnRateThresholds but that type is not defined; add a new
BurnRateThresholds type immediately after the SLOConfig block with four fields:
FastBurnRate (float64) and FastBurnWindow (time.Duration) for the fast alert
threshold and its evaluation window, and SlowBurnRate (float64) and
SlowBurnWindow (time.Duration) for the slow alert threshold and its evaluation
window, each with brief inline comments explaining units (budget/hour for rates,
time.Duration for windows).

BacklogGrowthWarning/BacklogGrowthCritical: "items/second";
ErrorRateWarning/ErrorRateCritical: "0–1"; LatencyP95Warning/LatencyP95Critical:
"ms"), and add a concise explanatory table or short paragraph immediately
beneath the struct and its JSON examples that lists each field, its unit, and
valid range so readers and JSON consumers have clear expectations.

```text
In docs/api/anomaly-radar-slo-budget.md around line 124, there is no
machine-readable API spec; create an OpenAPI 3.1 YAML file that models all
endpoints, request/response schemas, parameters, auth, and example payloads
described in this doc, add it to the repo (e.g., docs/api/openapi.yaml), update
this markdown to link to that file and include a brief note on versioning, and
add a CI job (using OpenAPI Generator CLI or similar) that validates the spec
and generates client SDKs (specify targets, output directory, and caching) on
merge so clients are produced automatically.

explicit Content-Type and status codes; add a short "Authentication &
Authorization" subsection stating the auth scheme (e.g., Bearer token) and
required RBAC roles for the endpoint, add a "Errors" subsection with the
standard JSON error shape (fields: error.code, error.message, error.details,
request_id) and list applicable HTTP error responses (401, 403, 422, 429 where

availability_target must be between 0 and 1 inclusive, latency_threshold_ms
positive integer, threshold rates between 0 and 1, types), state that invalid

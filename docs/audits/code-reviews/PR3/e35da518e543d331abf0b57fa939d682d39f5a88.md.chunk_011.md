Please act on each item by fixing the issue, or rejecting the feedback. Please update this document and fill out the information below each feedback item by replacing the text surrounded by curly braces.

### docs/api/dlq-remediation-pipeline.md:687

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In docs/api/dlq-remediation-pipeline.md around lines 676 to 687, the documented
error response only includes human text and status/timestamp; update the error
model to add a stable machine-readable "code" (string enum) and a "request_id"
(correlation id) field. Modify the example and API schema to include "code" with
a defined enum of values (e.g., rule_not_found, validation_error,
internal_error) and "request_id" as a UUID/string; document that every endpoint
must return a request_id header/value and include it in logs for tracing, and
update any related examples and schema definitions to reflect these new required
fields.

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 8 | Standardized the DLQ pipeline error envelope with codes plus request IDs. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Error responses need both human context and machine-readable identifiers to accelerate support.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Added `code` and `request_id` fields to the example, documented the `X-Request-ID` header, and enumerated the supported error codes in `docs/api/dlq-remediation-pipeline.md`.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> Keep the shared error envelope section authoritative so future endpoint docs copy the same structure.
>
> ## Notes
>
> Existing handlers already emit these fields—the docs now match reality.


### docs/api/dlq-remediation-pipeline.md:712

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In docs/api/dlq-remediation-pipeline.md around lines 701 to 712, the
rate-limiting section is missing Retry-After semantics, header units, and
scope/precedence of limits; add that 429 responses include a Retry-After header
(with seconds or an HTTP-date) and describe that X-RateLimit-Reset is a Unix
timestamp in seconds (epoch) indicating when the window resets; explicitly state
whether limits are enforced per-principal (API key/token) and/or per-IP and
which takes precedence when both apply (e.g., per-principal overrides per-IP or
both are enforced and the most restrictive applies), and clarify deterministic
behavior for clients (how remaining counters and reset are calculated and which
header to trust for backoff). Ensure the new text is concise and includes header
names, units, 429 use, and scope/precedence rules.

> | 8 | Clarified rate-limit headers, Retry-After semantics, and limit precedence. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Clients need explicit header units and precedence rules to back off deterministically.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Expanded the rate-limiting section to document `Retry-After`, clarified that `X-RateLimit-Reset` is epoch seconds, and explained how per-principal and per-IP windows interact.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> Treat the doc section as the canonical contract and mirror any future limiter tweaks here first.
>
> ## Notes
>
> No code changes required—the service already sends these headers.


### docs/api/dlq-remediation-pipeline.md:731

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In docs/api/dlq-remediation-pipeline.md around lines 713 to 731, the docs
currently only describe offset pagination which can misbehave under large lists
and concurrent writes; add a cursor-based pagination variant and document stable
sort keys: describe new query params (cursor — opaque token, limit with default
and max), explain that the backend must return a next_cursor (and prev_cursor
optionally) instead of has_next/has_prev, provide example request/response JSON
for the cursor flow, and call out that results must be ordered by one or more
stable sort keys (e.g., created_at ASC + id ASC as tie-breaker) so cursors
remain consistent under concurrent writes; also mention migration guidance
(support both offset and cursor endpoints or parameters) and recommend using
opaque base64 cursors that encode the last item sort-key values.

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 9 | Documented cursor pagination alongside the legacy offset flow. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Cursor docs must describe ordering, tokens, and migration to avoid data races under load.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Added a cursor subsection with query parameters, ordering guarantees, example request/response bodies, and guidance to prefer opaque Base64 cursors.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> Keep both offset and cursor sections synchronized until offset support is formally deprecated.
>
> ## Notes
>
> Included optional `prev_cursor` to match the API’s response payload.


### docs/api/dlq-remediation-ui.md:436

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In docs/api/dlq-remediation-ui.md around lines 432 to 436, the purge-all example
uses an unsafe query-string API; replace it with the documented safe POST body
API: change the curl example to a bash code block that sends a POST to
/api/dlq/entries/purge-all with headers Content-Type: application/json,
Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN, and Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen), and a JSON body
like {"confirm": true, "filter": {"queue":"test-queue"}} (use proper backtick
fencing for the bash block).

>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> High-risk examples should demonstrate the safest available API surface.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Replaced the query-string purge-all call with a POST example that sets `Authorization`, `Content-Type`, `Idempotency-Key`, and a JSON body.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> Audit remaining examples periodically to ensure they align with current guardrails.
>
> ## Notes
>
> Example now matches the production endpoint contract.


### docs/SLAPS/worker-reflections/claude-008-reflection.md:16

- [ ] Fixed

- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
docs/SLAPS/worker-reflections/claude-008-reflection.md lines 1-16: add a YAML
front-matter block at the top containing date and worker_id (e.g., date:
YYYY-MM-DD and worker_id: claude-008) and update the headings to match the other
reflections (use consistent header levels and phrasing such as "SLAPS Reflection
— Worker 8 (claude-008)" and "Summary" / "Tasks" instead of the current informal
titles); ensure the front-matter is the very first content, remove or tighten
any verbose header wording to be parallel with other files, and keep the rest of
the content intact.

> Consistent front matter and headings make the reflection archive searchable.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Added YAML front matter (date + worker_id) and restructured the document with standardized section headings.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> Use the same template for future reflections to keep the collection uniform.
>
> ## Notes

> Narrative content is intact—only structure changed.


### README.md:53

- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In README.md lines 44-48 the build section targets Go 1.25, but go.mod (line 3)
still declares `go 1.24.0`; update go.mod line 3 to `go 1.25` (or `1.25.0`) so
it matches README and the CI workflow files (ci.yml, release.yml,
goreleaser.yml, changelog.yml which use go-version: '1.25.x'), commit the change
and re-run CI to verify everything passes.

>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Checked the root go.mod (line 3) and verified it already specifies `go 1.25`, so no additional edits were necessary.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy

> Keep go.mod updates and documentation changes in the same PR to avoid future drift.
>
> ## Notes

```text
README.md around lines 70 to 86: new users will hit missing Go modules when
running or building the TUI; add a one‑liner before the run/build examples
telling users to fetch dependencies first by running the Go modules download
command (e.g., "go mod download") so they know to resolve deps prior to go run
or go build.

> ## Lesson Learned

> Docs should surface the first failure new contributors will hit and solve it up front.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Inserted a `go mod download` step ahead of the TUI run/build examples in README.md.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> When adding new entrypoints, include the preflight commands alongside them.
>
> ## Notes
>
> No functional changes—just smoother onboarding.

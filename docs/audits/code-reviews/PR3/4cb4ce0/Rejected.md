In .github/CODEOWNERS around lines 5 to 18, the file duplicates ownership
entries that are already covered by the top-level wildcard "* @flyingrobots";
remove the redundant pattern lines (.github/**, deploy/**, cmd/**, internal/**,
test/**) so that the single wildcard entry remains as the default owner, keeping
only any specific overrides if truly needed.

```text
In BUGS.md around lines 27-28: the repo currently depends on both
github.com/go-redis/redis/v8 and redis/go-redis/v9; pick v9 only, remove v8
references, and wrap the v9 client behind a small local interface (e.g. Cmdable)
used throughout the codebase for easier testing. Update all imports to
redis/go-redis/v9, replace any v8-specific types/usages with their v9
equivalents, add/adjust the interface file and constructor to return the
interface, update go.mod to remove the v8 dependency and run go mod tidy, and
fix tests/mocks to use the new interface so the duplicate dependency tree is
eliminated.

```text
In deploy/grafana/dashboards/work-queue.json lines 1-37, the dashboard currently
only defines five panels and lacks operational essentials: add a top-level
"time" range object (e.g., from/to defaults such as now-1h/now) so users can
change window; add a "templating" block with query variables for queue, worker,
and environment (using label_values on relevant metrics) so panels can be
filtered; add an "annotations" block to surface deployments and incidents
(Prometheus expressions such as changes(build_info[...])); convert key panels
(queue length, job failure rate, circuit breaker state) to include alerting
rules with sensible thresholds, evaluation window and for/conditions and add
panel threshold visualization and reduceOptions as needed; and add SLO-focused
panels (error budget burn rate, availability over time, SLO target lines) and an
availability/alerts panel tied to SLO thresholds. Ensure all added fields follow
Grafana dashboard JSON schema and reference the Prometheus datasource/metric
labels used elsewhere in this file.

### docs/api/anomaly-radar-slo-budget.md:521

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In docs/api/anomaly-radar-slo-budget.md around lines 519 to 521, the README
references a /debug endpoint without specifying its contract; either fully
document the endpoint or remove the snippet. If keeping it, add a clear spec:
HTTP method, full path, required auth/headers, request body or query params with
types and validation rules, example request (curl) and example successful and
error responses with status codes and JSON schema; if removing it, delete the
curl snippet and any other mentions of /debug in this doc to avoid misleading
users.

### docs/api/chaos-harness.md:283

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In docs/api/chaos-harness.md around lines 259 to 283, the example imports an
internal package which cannot be imported outside the module; change the import
to the public package path (for example
github.com/flyingrobots/go-redis-work-queue/pkg/chaosharness) and update the
example to use that package name, and if the chaosharness code currently lives
under internal/ move or re-export it under pkg/chaosharness (or otherwise make
it publicly importable) so the example compiles for external users.

### docs/api/dlq-remediation-ui.md:10

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In docs/api/dlq-remediation-ui.md around lines 7 to 10, the documentation
currently states the API is unauthenticated; update the docs and implementation
guidance to require authentication and role-based access control for any
endpoints that can requeue or purge jobs. Replace the “no authentication” note
with explicit instructions that anonymous access is banned, list the required
authentication mechanism (e.g., JWT bearer tokens or mTLS) and required RBAC
roles/permissions (e.g., admin:dlq:manage), and add an example request header
and a short note to enforce auth in production deployments and tests. Ensure the
docs also call out auditing/logging for destructive actions and recommend
least-privilege role assignment.

### docs/api/dlq-remediation-ui.md:39

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In docs/api/dlq-remediation-ui.md around lines 25 to 39, the docs currently
state "max 1000" and mention "rate limits" ambiguously; update the text to
explicitly state that the page_size maximum of 1000 is enforced server-side and
that any rate limits are enforced server-side as well (include where applicable:
page_size and any API rate limiting behavior), e.g., change descriptive cells to
assert server-side enforcement and add a short note clarifying that requests
exceeding page_size or rate limits will be rejected with appropriate HTTP error
codes and messages.
```

### docs/api/dlq-remediation-ui.md:241

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In docs/api/dlq-remediation-ui.md around lines 223-241, the purge-all endpoint
currently uses a dangerous confirm=true query parameter; change the docs to
require a POST body with a boolean "confirm" and a "filter" object
(queue,type,error_pattern,start_time,end_time,min_attempts,max_attempts) instead
of query confirm, and document that callers MUST supply an Idempotency-Key
header and a privileged scope/permission to invoke this operation; add
requirements to validate the request body schema, enforce the privileged scope
check on the server, persist the Idempotency-Key with the operation result to
make the purge idempotent and return the stored result (or a 409/appropriate
response) for duplicate keys, and update the endpoint example and params table
to show the request body and required Idempotency-Key header instead of a
confirm query param.
```

### docs/api/dlq-remediation-ui.md:257

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In docs/api/dlq-remediation-ui.md around lines 247 to 257, the JSON example
contains an invalid string "..." inside the successful array; replace it with
valid JSON by either listing only the real example entries (e.g. two sample IDs)
or by truncating the array (e.g. show the first two entries and remove the
ellipsis entirely), keeping the rest of the response fields unchanged so the
example is valid JSON.

### docs/api/dlq-remediation-ui.md:307

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In docs/api/dlq-remediation-ui.md around lines 299 to 307, the HTTP status codes
table omits authentication/authorization responses; add rows for 401
Unauthorized and 403 Forbidden with concise descriptions (e.g., "401 -
Unauthorized: Authentication required or invalid credentials" and "403 -
Forbidden: Authenticated but insufficient permissions") and ensure the security
section references these codes where relevant so auth failures are documented
alongside other status codes.

### EVENT_HOOKS_TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md:262

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In EVENT_HOOKS_TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md around lines 246 to 262, the listed
performance numbers are presented without context and are misleading; update the
section to replace the single numeric estimates with concrete measurement
details: for each metric state the test environment (hardware, OS, network—e.g.,
localhost vs remote), payload sizes, concurrency level, measurement
tool/version, sample size and duration, and the statistical results (p50/p95/p99
plus mean and standard deviation) and link to raw test scripts/logs; remove or
qualify any numbers that cannot be reproduced and, where appropriate, note
whether the metric was measured under unit, integration, or load-testing
conditions so readers can reproduce the results.

### .github/workflows/markdownlint.yml:3

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In .github/workflows/markdownlint.yml around line 3 the reserved YAML key on is
unquoted and triggers yamllint; either quote the key by changing on: to "on":
(or 'on':) or add a yamllint disable directive for that line (e.g. the
appropriate yamllint disable-line comment) so the linter is silenced while
preserving the existing workflow semantics.
```

### .github/workflows/update-progress.yml:24

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
.github/workflows/update-progress.yml lines 16-24: the workflow currently
references actions with mutable tags (actions/checkout@v4 and
actions/setup-python@v5); replace those two uses: entries with the recommended
immutable commit SHAs provided
(actions/checkout@08eba0b27e820071cde6df949e0beb9ba4906955 and
actions/setup-python@a26af69be951a213d495a4c3e4e4022e16d87065) so the workflow
is pinned to fixed commits while preserving existing with: options (fetch-depth
and python-version).
```

### .gitignore:16

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In .gitignore around line 16 (where /gocache/ is listed), add an entry for
go.work.sum to ignore the Go workspace checksum file; simply append a line with
go.work.sum (or the pattern /go.work.sum) next to /gocache/ so the workspace
checksum isn't committed.
```

{response}

### .gitignore:33

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In .gitignore around lines 28-33, you need to prevent accidental commits of
environment/secret files: add entries to ignore common env filenames (e.g. .env,
.env.* , .env.local, .env.production) while keeping any explicit templates like
.env.example tracked; update the file by appending those patterns (or placing
them before any allow rules) so env files are excluded from git commits.
```

### append_metadata.py:33

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In append_metadata.py around lines 30 to 33, format_list currently returns "-
[]" for empty lists which emits YAML that is a list with a string "[]"; change
format_list to emit a proper YAML empty list (i.e., the key followed by "[]" on
the same line without a dash) when items is empty, and when items exist produce
one "- item" per line with the prefix preserved; then update
generate_yaml_metadata to inline empty collections for soft/enables/provides on
the same line (key: []) rather than emitting a dash line, and apply this same
empty-list handling to soft, enables, and provides.
```

{response}

### append_metadata.py:59

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In append_metadata.py around lines 35 to 59 (and also apply same pattern to
lines 125-131), the script currently mutates files on import; wrap the
procedural code in a main() function and add an if __name__ == "__main__":
main() guard so nothing runs on import, surround file-processing logic with
try/except to log or print errors and continue safely, and ensure the target
DAG/ideas directory exists before writing (os.makedirs(ideas_dir,
exist_ok=True)) to avoid missing-directory errors; update the referenced lines
accordingly to call main and handle exceptions.
```

### BUGS.md:25

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In BUGS.md around lines 12 to 25, the heartbeat snippet is unsafe: it ignores
errors, can lose the key TTL, and doesn’t create the heartbeat atomically. Fix
by (1) creating the hb key atomically at start using Redis SET with NX and PX
(or PEXPIRE immediately after a successful SET), (2) renewing using SET with XX
and PX (or PEXPIRE) so you only extend an existing key, (3) adding randomized
jitter to the renewal interval (e.g., renew at TTL/3 ± jitter) to avoid
thundering herds, (4) checking and logging Redis command errors and handling
transient failures with a small retry/backoff or escalate and exit the worker if
renewals repeatedly fail, and (5) ensuring the ticker is stopped and cancel() is
called before performing final LREM/DEL so the background renew goroutine exits
cleanly.
```

{response}

### BUGS.md:38

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In BUGS.md around lines 32-38, the current code scans Redis with pattern
"jobqueue:*" which floods Redis Cluster across slots; change the reaper to
either (A) maintain and iterate a registry (e.g., a SET of active worker/queue
IDs) and use SMEMBERS to fetch per-worker keys, or (B) use Redis hash-tags so
all jobqueue keys for a worker live in the same slot (e.g.,
jobqueue:{workerID}:processing) and then SCAN only that single slot per worker;
implement one of these approaches and update the description and example in the
doc to show scanning per-worker keys or iterating the SET instead of a global
SCAN "jobqueue:*".
```

### BUGS.md:53

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In BUGS.md around lines 45–53 the scheduler mover uses ZRANGEBYSCORE + ZREM +
LPUSH in a pipeline which is racy and can double‑enqueue under concurrency;
replace this with an atomic operation: either implement a loop using ZPOPMIN to
pop due members and LPUSH them (ensuring you process only members with score <=
now) or, preferably, write a single Lua script that atomically pops all due
members from the sorted set and pushes them to the list in one server-side
operation; update the code to call the Lua script (or ZPOPMIN loop) and remove
the non‑atomic pipeline approach so deliveries cannot be duplicated.
```

### BUGS.md:61

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In BUGS.md around lines 55–61, the advice to write NDJSON ledger files to local
disk risks data loss and PII leakage; change the guidance to require routing
ledger events to a durable sink (S3/Blob store, Kafka, or equivalent) or, if
local append-only files are used, mandate atomic appenders with daily rotation,
size caps, gzip/archive rotation, and documented retention; require payload
redaction/scrubbing of PII before writing (or write only event metadata and
references), implement backpressure and retry/fallback logic on IO failures so
handlers are not blocked, and add documentation for retention/rotation policy
and monitoring/alerts.

### claude_worker.py:34

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In claude_worker.py around lines 29 to 34, only self.my_dir is created but other
directories (self.finished_dir, self.failed_dir, self.help_dir, and
self.open_tasks_dir) are written to later and may not exist; update the
initialization to mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True) for each of those directory
attributes as well (create self.finished_dir, self.failed_dir, self.help_dir,
and self.open_tasks_dir up front) so all required directories exist before any
file operations.

### cmd/job-queue-system/main.go:161

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In cmd/job-queue-system/main.go around lines 159-161 (and similarly at 169-171
and 193-201) you’re ignoring json.Marshal errors and printing possibly corrupt
output; replace json.MarshalIndent usage with a json.Encoder writing to
os.Stdout (use encoder.SetIndent("", "  ") for pretty output) and call
encoder.Encode(value), check and handle the returned error (log to stderr and
return/exit with non-zero status or propagate the error) instead of discarding
it; apply the same pattern to every JSON output in runAdmin.
```

### create_postmortem_tasks.py:3

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In create_postmortem_tasks.py around lines 1-3, the code appends "Z" to a naive
local datetime which is incorrect; instead import and use a timezone-aware UTC
datetime (e.g., add "from datetime import timezone" and call
datetime.now(timezone.utc)) and emit an ISO8601 UTC timestamp (convert to ISO
format and normalize to Z or use isoformat with UTC) so timestamps are real Zulu
time rather than local time with a trailing "Z".
```

{response}

### create_postmortem_tasks.py:16

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In create_postmortem_tasks.py around lines 15 to 16, the code appends "Z" to
datetime.now() which produces a fake UTC timestamp; update both timestamp sites
to produce real UTC-aware ISO timestamps by using
datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat() (or
datetime.utcnow().replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc).isoformat()), import timezone
from datetime, and remove the manual "Z" concatenation so timestamps are
properly UTC-aware.
```

### create_postmortem_tasks.py:39

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In create_postmortem_tasks.py around lines 27 to 39, the criteria strings still
contain raw placeholders "{i}" and "{worker}" which won't be interpolated;
replace those literal placeholders with properly formatted/interpolated strings
(e.g., use f-strings or .format with the loop variables i and worker) so the
criteria read the actual worker index and name, and ensure any literal braces
intended to stay are escaped; update the list entries to build their strings
dynamically using the current i/worker variables.
```

### create_postmortem_tasks.py:70

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In create_postmortem_tasks.py around lines 69-70, the timestamp is created with
datetime.now(), which uses local time; change it to produce a UTC timestamp
(e.g., use datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z" or
datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()) and apply the same UTC-fix to the
coordinator task elsewhere in this file so all created_at values are uniform and
in UTC.
```

### create_review_tasks.py:11

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In create_review_tasks.py around lines 10-11, the check for "duplicate" is
case-sensitive so files like "Duplicate..." slip through; change the condition
to test against a lowercased filename (e.g., use 'duplicate' not in f.lower())
while keeping the .json check (you can call f.lower() for the duplicate check
only) so task_id = f[:-5] remains unchanged.
```

{response}

### create_review_tasks.py:21

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In create_review_tasks.py around lines 14 to 21, the code uses a bare except
which hides real errors; replace it by catching the specific exceptions that can
occur (e.g., IndexError and ValueError) when splitting/parsing task_id and,
instead of a silent pass, either continue the loop or log the parse failure; for
any truly unexpected exception re-raise or log and raise so real bugs aren’t
masked.

### demos/responsive-tui.tape:73

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In demos/responsive-tui.tape around lines 72-73 (and also at 129-130, 214-215,
307-308, 365), the script uses "Sleep 3s" which wastes CI minutes; remove these
Sleep commands and instead either remove the pause entirely or replace with a
deterministic check/wait-for-condition (e.g., wait for expected output or
prompt) so the test proceeds immediately when ready; update the surrounding
steps to rely on explicit assertions or readiness checks rather than fixed
sleeps.

### dependency_analysis.py:44

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In dependency_analysis.py around lines 23–166, there’s a naming inconsistency:
keys were defined with hyphens (e.g., "distributed-tracing-integration") but
code still references snake_case names ("distributed_tracing",
"storage_backend"); update all occurrences listed (distributed_tracing at lines
23, 41, 89, 107, 166 and storage_backend at line 112) to use the canonical
hyphenated keys, or alternatively add an explicit alias mapping near the top
that maps "distributed_tracing" -> "distributed-tracing-integration" and
"storage_backend" -> "storage-backends" and then use the canonical names
throughout; after making the edits run the provided rg command to confirm zero
unresolved nodes.

### deployments/admin-api/Dockerfile:37

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In deployments/admin-api/Dockerfile around lines 36 to 37 the HEALTHCHECK uses
wget but the final image doesn’t install wget; update the final stage to include
wget (e.g., add wget to the apk --no-cache add line alongside ca-certificates
and tzdata) or alternatively change the HEALTHCHECK to use a tool already
present (curl or busybox) — implement the preferred option so the health check
command exists in the final image.

```text
In docs/api/anomaly-radar-slo-budget.md around lines 519 to 521, the README
references a /debug endpoint without specifying its contract; either fully
document the endpoint or remove the snippet. If keeping it, add a clear spec:
HTTP method, full path, required auth/headers, request body or query params with
types and validation rules, example request (curl) and example successful and
error responses with status codes and JSON schema; if removing it, delete the
curl snippet and any other mentions of /debug in this doc to avoid misleading
users.

under internal/ move or re-export it under pkg/chaosharness (or otherwise make
it publicly importable) so the example compiles for external users.

```text
In docs/api/dlq-remediation-ui.md around lines 7 to 10, the documentation
currently states the API is unauthenticated; update the docs and implementation
guidance to require authentication and role-based access control for any
endpoints that can requeue or purge jobs. Replace the “no authentication” note
with explicit instructions that anonymous access is banned, list the required
authentication mechanism (e.g., JWT bearer tokens or mTLS) and required RBAC
roles/permissions (e.g., admin:dlq:manage), and add an example request header
and a short note to enforce auth in production deployments and tests. Ensure the
docs also call out auditing/logging for destructive actions and recommend
least-privilege role assignment.

require a POST body with a boolean "confirm" and a "filter" object
(queue,type,error_pattern,start_time,end_time,min_attempts,max_attempts) instead
of query confirm, and document that callers MUST supply an Idempotency-Key
header and a privileged scope/permission to invoke this operation; add
requirements to validate the request body schema, enforce the privileged scope
check on the server, persist the Idempotency-Key with the operation result to
make the purge idempotent and return the stored result (or a 409/appropriate
response) for duplicate keys, and update the endpoint example and params table
to show the request body and required Idempotency-Key header instead of a
confirm query param.

qualify any numbers that cannot be reproduced and, where appropriate, note
whether the metric was measured under unit, integration, or load-testing

```text
In BUGS.md around lines 12 to 25, the heartbeat snippet is unsafe: it ignores
errors, can lose the key TTL, and doesn’t create the heartbeat atomically. Fix
by (1) creating the hb key atomically at start using Redis SET with NX and PX
(or PEXPIRE immediately after a successful SET), (2) renewing using SET with XX
and PX (or PEXPIRE) so you only extend an existing key, (3) adding randomized
jitter to the renewal interval (e.g., renew at TTL/3 ± jitter) to avoid
thundering herds, (4) checking and logging Redis command errors and handling
transient failures with a small retry/backoff or escalate and exit the worker if
renewals repeatedly fail, and (5) ensuring the ticker is stopped and cancel() is
called before performing final LREM/DEL so the background renew goroutine exits
cleanly.

all jobqueue keys for a worker live in the same slot (e.g.,
jobqueue:{workerID}:processing) and then SCAN only that single slot per worker;

datetime.now() which produces a fake UTC timestamp; update both timestamp sites
to produce real UTC-aware ISO timestamps by using
datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat() (or
datetime.utcnow().replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc).isoformat()), import timezone
from datetime, and remove the manual "Z" concatenation so timestamps are
properly UTC-aware.

```text
In create_postmortem_tasks.py around lines 27 to 39, the criteria strings still
contain raw placeholders "{i}" and "{worker}" which won't be interpolated;
replace those literal placeholders with properly formatted/interpolated strings
(e.g., use f-strings or .format with the loop variables i and worker) so the
criteria read the actual worker index and name, and ensure any literal braces
intended to stay are escaped; update the list entries to build their strings
dynamically using the current i/worker variables.

```text
In create_postmortem_tasks.py around lines 69-70, the timestamp is created with
datetime.now(), which uses local time; change it to produce a UTC timestamp
(e.g., use datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z" or
datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()) and apply the same UTC-fix to the
coordinator task elsewhere in this file so all created_at values are uniform and
in UTC.

```text
In create_review_tasks.py around lines 10-11, the check for "duplicate" is
case-sensitive so files like "Duplicate..." slip through; change the condition
to test against a lowercased filename (e.g., use 'duplicate' not in f.lower())
while keeping the .json check (you can call f.lower() for the duplicate check
only) so task_id = f[:-5] remains unchanged.

```text
In create_review_tasks.py around lines 14 to 21, the code uses a bare except
which hides real errors; replace it by catching the specific exceptions that can

instead of a silent pass, either continue the loop or log the parse failure; for
any truly unexpected exception re-raise or log and raise so real bugs aren’t
masked.

```text
In demos/responsive-tui.tape around lines 72-73 (and also at 129-130, 214-215,
307-308, 365), the script uses "Sleep 3s" which wastes CI minutes; remove these
Sleep commands and instead either remove the pause entirely or replace with a
deterministic check/wait-for-condition (e.g., wait for expected output or
prompt) so the test proceeds immediately when ready; update the surrounding
steps to rely on explicit assertions or readiness checks rather than fixed
sleeps.

```text
In dependency_analysis.py around lines 23–166, there’s a naming inconsistency:
keys were defined with hyphens (e.g., "distributed-tracing-integration") but
code still references snake_case names ("distributed_tracing",
"storage_backend"); update all occurrences listed (distributed_tracing at lines
23, 41, 89, 107, 166 and storage_backend at line 112) to use the canonical
hyphenated keys, or alternatively add an explicit alias mapping near the top
that maps "distributed_tracing" -> "distributed-tracing-integration" and
"storage_backend" -> "storage-backends" and then use the canonical names
throughout; after making the edits run the provided rg command to confirm zero
unresolved nodes.

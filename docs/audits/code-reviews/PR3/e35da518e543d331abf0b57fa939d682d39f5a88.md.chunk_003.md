```text
In docs/14_ops_runbook.md around lines 51 to 75, the purge-dlq example and
surrounding admin CLI docs lack a dry-run example and an explicit RBAC note;
update the purge-dlq command example to include a --dry-run (and keep --yes
separate) showing safe preview usage, and add a short sentence noting that purge
operations require admin RBAC (e.g., only users/roles with purge/delete
permissions may execute) and recommend running dry-run first before --yes; keep
the other examples unchanged.

```text
In docs/api/dlq-remediation-pipeline.md around lines 121 to 137, the sample
response mixes integer and float types and embeds unit labels only in keys (ms),
which causes churn for clients; standardize metric types and lock units by (1)
making counts strictly integers (jobs_processed, jobs_matched, actions_executed,
actions_successful, actions_failed, rate_limit_hits, circuit_breaker_trips), (2)
expressing timing metrics as numbers in milliseconds as integers
(classification_time_ms, action_time_ms, end_to_end_time_ms) or explicitly state
they are floats if sub-millisecond precision is required, (3) keeping ratios/hit
rates as floats between 0 and 1 (cache_hit_rate), (4) update the JSON example to
use consistent types and values accordingly, and (5) add a short typed schema
section immediately after the example listing each field name, its JSON type,
and the unit (e.g., "classification_time_ms: integer (ms)") so clients have an
authoritative contract.

server pings and send an application-level heartbeat every N seconds, include
ping/pong timeouts and reconnect guidance), and define a
slow-consumer/backpressure policy (per-connection send buffer limits,
server-side queue thresholds, and the chosen strategy: drop oldest messages vs.
close connection with a close code and reason), plus recommend monitoring

### deployments/admin-api/monitoring.yaml:66

- [x] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In deployments/admin-api/monitoring.yaml lines 1-66: this ConfigMap duplicates
alerts already managed in deployments/kubernetes/monitoring.yaml and conflicts
with the monitoring operator (ConfigMap-based rules vs PrometheusRule). Fix by
either deleting this file entirely, or converting its contents into a
PrometheusRule (and ServiceMonitor if needed) CRD placed in the same namespace
and using the same labels/owner/namespace conventions as the existing monitoring
manifests under deployments/kubernetes/monitoring.yaml so the operator picks it
up; ensure you do not keep both ConfigMap and PrometheusRule definitions for the
same alerts to avoid duplication.
```

```text
In deployments/admin-api/monitoring.yaml around line 5 (and also line 71), the
namespace is set to "redis-work-queue" which conflicts with the expected
"work-queue"; update the namespace value(s) at those lines to the canonical
"work-queue" so all manifests/dashboards use the same namespace and avoid 404s.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|

> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Aligning namespaces across manifests prevents 404s when the operator loads resources.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Updated the PrometheusRule and dashboard metadata in `deployments/admin-api/monitoring.yaml:4-14` and `:80-90` to use `namespace: work-queue` consistently.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy

```text
In deployments/admin-api/monitoring.yaml around lines 58-65, the alert divides
by container_spec_memory_limit_bytes without matching labels which creates
cardinality/vector-matching issues; change the denominator to the
kube-state-metrics memory limit metric (e.g.
kube_pod_container_resource_limits_bytes{resource="memory"} or the equivalent
kube_pod_container_resource_limits{resource="memory", unit="byte"}) and perform
an explicit vector match so the usage and limit align (for example use
on(namespace,pod,container) or include identical pod/container selectors), or
remove the alert until you can implement correct label-matched limits.
```

```text
In deployments/admin-api/monitoring.yaml around lines 82 to 99 (and also lines

which is invalid; update every PromQL target in this file to use double quotes
for label values (e.g. {job="admin-api"}), including status regexes and any
other label matchers, and search/replace all occurrences across the file so all
targets use double-quoted label values.

```text
In deployments/kubernetes/monitoring.yaml around lines 72-84, the alert
expression divides container_memory_usage_bytes by
container_spec_memory_limit_bytes with mismatched labels and can divide by zero;
replace it to use the kube-state-metrics limits metric (e.g.
kube_pod_container_resource_limits_bytes or kube_pod_container_resource_limits)
and perform a proper vector match by namespace/pod/container (or use
on(namespace,pod,container) group_left if needed) and guard against zero limits
by filtering the limit metric to > 0 (or applying clamp_min(limit,1)) before
division so the resulting ratio is valid and safe for comparison.

In deployments/kubernetes/monitoring.yaml around lines 96-107, the rule
currently uses a boolean expr so $value becomes 0/1 and the annotation shows

fire the alert:
(certmanager_certificate_expiration_timestamp_seconds{name="admin-api-tls",namespace="your-namespace"}
- time()) < 7*24*3600, and (3) update the annotation to display the
time-to-expiry by evaluating the time-left expression, e.g. use {{
humanizeDuration
(certmanager_certificate_expiration_timestamp_seconds{name="admin-api-tls",namespace="your-namespace"}

the repo for the other occurrences and replace them to the chosen name so all

recording rules or exporters that emit the metric are updated to match the new
canonical name and run a quick lint/test of Prometheus rules to verify no

Please act on each item by fixing the issue, or rejecting the feedback. Please update this document and fill out the information below each feedback item by replacing the text surrounded by curly braces.

### deployments/admin-api/docker-compose.yaml:55

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [x] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In deployments/admin-api/docker-compose.yaml around line 55 the file is missing
a trailing newline at EOF; open the file and add a single newline character
after the last line ("driver: bridge") so the file ends with a newline, save and
commit the change.
```

> [!CAUTION]- **Rejected**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 7 | Confirmed the compose file already ends with a newline, so no edit was required. |
>
> ## Rejection Rationale
>
> Existing file already satisfies the requested newline-at-EOF requirement.
>
> ## What you did instead
>
> Inspected `deployments/admin-api/docker-compose.yaml` (byte-by-byte) to verify the trailing newline is present and documented the finding here.
>
> ## Tradeoffs considered
>
> Avoided an unnecessary rewrite that would churn the blame history without changing behaviour.
>
> ## What would make you change your mind
>
> Evidence from a fresh checkout or CI linter showing the newline is actually missing.
>
> ## Future Plans
>
> Keep trailing-newline checks in linting to catch any future regressions.

### deployments/docker/docker-compose.yaml:38

- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In deployments/docker/docker-compose.yaml around lines 36-38 (and also update
similar occurrences at 45-49 and 74-77), the RBAC mount is ./rbac-configs ->
/app/rbac but the env vars point to /app/configs/*.yaml and API_TOKEN_* values
are inlined; change the RBAC env vars to point to the actual mounted path
(/app/rbac/roles.yaml and /app/rbac/resources.yaml) and remove any hard-coded
API_TOKEN_* from the compose file, instead reference an env_file (admin-api.env)
or Docker secrets; update service definitions to load admin-api.env (ensure that
file is .gitignored) or declare docker secrets and replace API_TOKEN_* entries
with secret references.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 8 | Verified the compose stack now reads RBAC configs from the mounted path and loads API tokens via env_file. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Keeping secrets out of compose manifests while aligning path references prevents drift between mounts and runtime configuration.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Updated the `admin-api` service to source RBAC files from `/app/rbac`, introduced an `env_file` for API tokens, removed the hard-coded `API_TOKEN_*` entries, added a sample `admin-api.env.example`, and ignored the real `admin-api.env` in git.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> Documented the example env file and rely on gitignore plus review checks to keep secrets out of version control.
>
> ## Notes
>
> No automated tests cover compose manifests; manual inspection only.

incompatibility with depends_on health condition; add a single newline character
at the end of the file, and if you rely on depends_on: condition:
service_healthy ensure each dependent service defines a proper healthcheck and
verify behaviour against your Compose implementation (run docker compose
version) — if incompatibility exists, either remove the condition and gate
startup in the service entrypoint or migrate to a Compose version that supports
health conditions.

>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?

invocation with an equivalent curl-based healthcheck command (use curl options
to fail on non-2xx, be silent, set a timeout, and return non-zero on failure)

runtime package list or use a base image that includes curl) so the healthcheck
works and matches project convention.

commands currently suppress failures with "2>/dev/null || true", which hides
missing config files; decide whether these configs are required or optional and
remove the error-suppression accordingly: if required, delete the redirections
and "|| true" so the build fails loudly when files are missing and update build
artifacts to include the files; if optional, remove the suppressions and instead
implement an explicit presence check (or adjust the application to handle
missing configs) and use a conditional copy strategy in the Docker build
pipeline (e.g., stage the files only when present) so missing files are handled
intentionally rather than silently ignored.

```text
In deployments/docker/rbac-configs/roles.yaml around lines 95 to 102, add a
terminating newline at EOF to satisfy YAML linters, and update the file to
explicitly document how role_assignment_rules are enforced and their precedence:
state which component (token service, API gateway, or other) applies these
rules, describe whether matching is based on token claims, user attributes, or
group memberships, and clarify precedence order between domain-based rules and
explicit user/group mappings (e.g., user/group overrides domain rules or vice
versa). Ensure the documentation snippet is concise, placed near the
role_assignment_rules section, and includes an example showing resolution order
so readers know which mapping wins.

```text
In deployments/docker/rbac-configs/token-service.yaml around line 28, the
encryption_key currently falls back to the insecure default
"default-dev-key-change-in-production"; remove that hardcoded default so the
value must come from RBAC_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY (e.g. use the env var without a
default), and add startup validation that requires RBAC_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY (and
REDIS_PASSWORD) and fails fast on missing vars; implement a small
startup_validation section that lists required_env_vars and fail_fast: true so
the service refuses to start when those secrets are not provided.

data flow diagrams (request/response paths between Admin API, RBAC Token

In deployments/admin-api/k8s-deployment.yaml around lines 42-43 the jwt-secret
is set to a weak hardcoded value ("change-me-in-production"); replace this by
generating a cryptographically secure secret (e.g., 32+ random bytes,
base64/hex-encoded) and remove the hardcoded value from the manifest, store the
secret in a Kubernetes Secret (or external secret manager like Vault/Secrets
Manager) and reference it via secretKeyRef/envFrom in the Deployment; ensure the
secret is not checked into source control, grant minimal RBAC to access it, and
document rotation/management procedures.

### deployments/admin-api/k8s-deployment.yaml:65

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In deployments/admin-api/k8s-deployment.yaml around line 65, the container image
is pinned to the non-deterministic tag "redis-work-queue/admin-api:latest";
replace this with a reproducible identifier (semantic version tag like
redis-work-queue/admin-api:vX.Y.Z or the image digest
redis-work-queue/admin-api@sha256:...) produced by your CI build, update the
manifest to use that tag/digest, and ensure your release pipeline publishes and
updates manifests automatically (or documents the manual step) so Kubernetes
deployments reference an immutable image for production.

### deployments/admin-api/k8s-deployment.yaml:197

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In deployments/admin-api/k8s-deployment.yaml around line 197, the file is
missing a trailing newline at EOF; fix by adding a single newline character at
the end of the file so the file ends with a blank line, then commit;
additionally, add a CI linting rule (e.g., via eol-last in linters or a
YAML/file-format check) to enforce trailing newlines for all YAML files.

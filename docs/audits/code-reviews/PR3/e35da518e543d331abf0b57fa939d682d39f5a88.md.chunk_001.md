- [ ] Test Written
- [x] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In .github/CODEOWNERS around lines 5 to 18, the file duplicates ownership
entries that are already covered by the top-level wildcard "* @flyingrobots";
remove the redundant pattern lines (.github/**, deploy/**, cmd/**, internal/**,
test/**) so that the single wildcard entry remains as the default owner, keeping
only any specific overrides if truly needed.
```

> [!CAUTION]- **Rejected**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 7 | Verified current CODEOWNERS only contains the wildcard owner, so the duplication is already resolved. |

> ## Rejection Rationale
>
> Repository already matches suggested end state; no redundant patterns remain to remove.
>
> ## What you did instead
>
> Confirmed file contents and documented decision here.
>
> ## Tradeoffs considered
>
> No change keeps history untouched; alternative would have been a no-op edit.
>
> ## What would make you change your mind
>
> Evidence of duplicate patterns reappearing or a policy requiring explicit cleanup commit despite identical content.
>
> ## Future Plans
>
> Monitor future additions to CODEOWNERS for redundancy during reviews.

### .github/workflows/changelog.yml:29

- [x] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
.github/workflows/changelog.yml around lines 28-29: the command uses unquoted
command substitution $(go env GOPATH) which can break due to word-splitting
(SC2046); change it to quote the substitution so the path is treated as a single
word (e.g. use "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/git-chglog" in the run line) and keep the
existing fallback (|| echo ...) as-is so the workflow behaves the same on
failure.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 8 | Confirmed the workflow already wraps the substitution in quotes and preserved fallback behaviour. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Double-checking shell quoting in automation prevents SC2046-style regressions without requiring extra script wrappers.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Reviewed the `Generate CHANGELOG.md` step and confirmed it already invokes `"$(go env GOPATH)"/bin/git-chglog`, matching the requested quoting semantics.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> Keep shell fragments minimal and rely on ShellCheck in CI to flag future word-splitting risks.
>
> ## Notes

> No additional workflow edits were necessary—the current revision already satisfied the recommendation.

### .github/workflows/changelog.yml:38

- [x] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In .github/workflows/changelog.yml around lines 36-38, the workflow pushes
directly to the default branch and can have concurrent runs collide; add a
top-level concurrency stanza to serialize runs (use a stable group key tied to
the repository/workflow, e.g. "changelog-${{ github.repository }}-${{
github.workflow }}" or include default_branch) and set cancel-in-progress: false
so only one push to the default branch runs at a time; add this concurrency
block at the top of the workflow YAML to prevent race-prone pushes.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 8 | Concurrency stanza already present at top of workflow and matches requested group/cancel semantics. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Serialising push-on-main workflows avoids self-conflicting automation and is easy to express via GitHub’s concurrency controls.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Audited `.github/workflows/changelog.yml` and verified the concurrency block (`group: changelog-${{ github.repository }}-${{ github.workflow }}` with `cancel-in-progress: false`) is committed.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> Keep workflow templates with concurrency boilerplate and lint them during reviews for ongoing assurance.
>
> ## Notes

> No further edits required; documentation updated here to record the confirmation.

### .github/workflows/ci.yml:45

- [x] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
.github/workflows/ci.yml around lines 38 to 45: the workflow immediately starts
5 E2E runs against localhost:6379 without verifying Redis is ready, causing
flaky failures; add a readiness gate prior to the for-loop that waits for Redis
to respond (e.g., loop using redis-cli ping until it returns PONG or timeout, or
use a small curl/openssl TCP probe) and fail fast if timeout is reached; place
the wait logic just before the for i in {1..5} loop so tests only start after
Redis health is confirmed.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 8 | CI workflow now waits for Redis before the E2E loop, matching the requested gating. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Guarding integration tests with simple readiness probes drastically reduces flakiness.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Checked `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and confirmed the `Wait for Redis readiness` step performs a TCP probe with retries before the five-run E2E loop.

- [x] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In .github/workflows/goreleaser.yml around lines 25 to 27, the echo redirections
use an unquoted $GITHUB_ENV which can break on filenames with spaces or special
chars; update the two lines so the redirection target is quoted (use >>
"$GITHUB_ENV") and keep the echoed strings quoted as-is to ensure safe, portable
assignment into the env file.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 9 | Updated workflow writes to `"$GITHUB_ENV"`, eliminating the unquoted redirection. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Always quote GitHub-provided file paths in workflows to avoid subtle failures on unusual runners.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Edited the `Set repo env` step to append variables with `>> "$GITHUB_ENV"`, matching SC2086 guidance.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> Keep shell linting (e.g., ShellCheck) in the workflow review checklist so new steps follow the same quoting pattern.
>
> ## Notes

### .github/workflows/goreleaser.yml:33

- [x] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In .github/workflows/goreleaser.yml around lines 28-33, the workflow logs into
GHCR but does not set up QEMU or Docker Buildx for multi-arch builds; add steps
before the login/build steps to (1) register QEMU emulators (use
actions/setup-qemu-action@v2) and (2) create/enable a buildx builder (use
docker/setup-buildx-action@v2), ensuring buildx is the active builder and
supports the target platforms; keep the login step but then invoke buildx-based
multi-platform build/push (or ensure goreleaser step uses buildx) so multi-arch
images are built correctly.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 9 | Added QEMU and Buildx setup steps ahead of GoReleaser to ensure multi-arch builds succeed. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Preparing multi-arch toolchains in CI keeps container releases reproducible across amd64/arm64.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Inserted `docker/setup-qemu-action@v3` and `docker/setup-buildx-action@v3` steps before the GHCR login in the GoReleaser workflow.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> Retain these setup steps near the top of the job and document them in release workflow guidelines so future edits don’t drop them.
>
> ## Notes
>
> Multi-arch publishing now relies on the configured Buildx builder; GoReleaser action picks it up automatically.

### .github/workflows/markdownlint.yml:6

- [x] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
.github/workflows/markdownlint.yml around line 6: the branch array uses spaces
inside the brackets ("[ main ]") which trips YAML/style linters; change it to
use no inner spacing ("[main]") so the array is formatted as a compact literal
and passes linting.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 8 | Branch array rewritten as `[main]`, satisfying markdownlint and YAML format guidance. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Minor YAML style fixes keep linting noise out of CI and speed up reviews.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Updated the workflow’s `push` trigger to `branches: [main]` (no interior spaces).
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> Continue running `yamllint` locally to catch future spacing regressions automatically.

- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
.github/workflows/markdownlint.yml lines 12-21: the workflow lacks
least-privilege permissions and concurrency control; add a permissions block
granting only what the job needs (e.g., permissions: contents: read) at the
workflow level and add a concurrency key to cancel duplicate runs (e.g., group
using workflow/ref or workflow/run id with cancel-in-progress: true) so runners
aren’t wasted and attack surface is reduced.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 8 | Workflow now ships with least-privilege permissions and concurrency guard as requested. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Explicit permissions and concurrency hints prevent CI bottlenecks and security surprises.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Added `permissions: contents: read` and a `concurrency` block (`markdownlint-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}` with cancel-on-dup) to the workflow header.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> Base future workflow scaffolding on this hardened template to keep defaults tight.
>
> ## Notes

```text
.goreleaser.yaml around lines 15 to 20: the archives block currently produces
tar.gz for all OSes (including Windows); change it to keep tar.gz for
non-Windows and add a format_overrides entry that sets format: zip for
goos/windows so Windows builds produce zip archives. Update the archives stanza
to include format_overrides with a selector for goos: windows -> format: zip
(and ensure name_template remains appropriate for both formats).
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**

```text
.goreleaser.yaml around lines 38 to 41: the current owner/name fields use bare
templates which fail YAML linting and are unnecessary for releasing to the same

or if you must keep them wrap the template values in quotes (e.g. owner: "{{
.Env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER }}" and name: "{{ .Env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME }}")
to produce valid YAML.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**

```text
In .markdownlint.yaml at line 4 the config disables MD013 repo-wide; remove the
global "MD013: false" entry and instead apply targeted exceptions: delete that
line from the repo config and either add per-file overrides in the markdownlint
config for specific file globs, or keep MD013 enabled and use inline markers
(<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 --> / <!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->),
per-line disables, or file front-matter to silence the rule only where long
lines are intentional.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**

into explicit sections such as Added, Changed, Fixed (and optionally
Removed/Deprecated) and move each bullet under the appropriate section, convert
informal bullets into concise changelog-style lines, and append PR references
(e.g. " (#123)") for each item — leave a placeholder for PR numbers to be filled
in once merged and add a short header with the release version and date; ensure
the final format matches other entries in the file and includes a
[request_verification] note to confirm PR numbers after merge.

```text
In create_review_tasks.py around lines 22-24 (and also update the similar logic
at lines 27-35), the code lexically sorts task identifiers which misorders items
like "T10" vs "T9"; change the sort to extract the numeric portion and sort by
that numeric value instead. Implement a sort key that parses the integer from
each task string (e.g., regex or split to grab trailing digits), fallback to 0
if no number present, then use sorted(completed_tasks, key=that_numeric_key) and
slice [:12]; apply the same numeric-key sorting to the other block at lines
27-35.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 8 | Numeric sort helper ensures tasks order naturally (T9 before T10). |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Lexical sorts often fail mixed-letter/number IDs; investing in a numeric key keeps ordering intuitive.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Added `_task_numeric_key` using regex extraction to sort completed task IDs by their numeric suffix before slicing.

```text
In demos/responsive-tui.tape around lines 20 to 27 (and similarly at 81-88 and
138-146), the script sets COLUMNS to simulate mobile layout but this is cosmetic
for most tools; update the demo to either display an explicit on-screen note
that setting COLUMNS is only cosmetic, or trigger the TUI's real layout switch
API/flag if available so the UI truly reflows; also reduce sleep/delay durations
used around these sections to speed CI. Ensure the note is visible before the
COLUMNS change (or replace the COLUMNS step with a proper layout switch), and
apply the same change to the other line ranges mentioned.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**

app-all and app-producer to point to the existing path (e.g.,
./deploy/data:/data or an absolute path). Ensure the chosen fix is applied
consistently for all services and update any related documentation or .gitignore
entries if paths change.

### deploy/grafana/dashboards/work-queue.json:9

- [x] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In deploy/grafana/dashboards/work-queue.json around lines 6 to 9, the PromQL
uses incorrect aggregation syntax "sum(...) by (le)"; change it to use the "sum
by (le) (...)" form and wrap the rate() call inside that aggregation so the
histogram_quantile receives a properly aggregated timeseries (i.e., compute rate
on the bucket metric over 5m, then apply sum by (le) around that result before
calling histogram_quantile).
```

```text
In deploy/grafana/dashboards/work-queue.json around lines 20-24 (and likewise
adjust panels at lines 31-35), the stat panels lack units, thresholds and
field/state mappings; update the "Circuit Breaker State" stat to include
field/value mappings (0 -> "Closed (OK)" with green, 1 -> "Open (Alert)" with
red, 2 -> "Half-Open (Warn)" with amber), add a unit (e.g., "state" or "none"),
and set a reduce/threshold/color scheme so the numerical values render as
labeled colored states; for the "active workers" stat set unit to "none", add
thresholds so >0 is green and =0 is red, and ensure both panels use appropriate
fieldConfig -> mappings and thresholds entries so the UI shows readable labels
and colors at a glance.

```text
In deploy/grafana/dashboards/work-queue.json around lines 26 to 29, the
Prometheus target uses a raw metric "queue_length" which emits one time series
per replica; change the query to aggregate across replicas per logical queue
(for example use sum by (queue)(queue_length) or sum without grouping then
group_by the queue label) so the panel shows one series per queue rather than
one per instance, and update the legend/labeling to include the queue label for
clarity.

- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
deployments/admin-api/k8s-redis.yaml lines 1-62: the manifest lacks any
pod/container security hardening; add a podSecurityContext and container
securityContext plus a locked ServiceAccount: set
spec.template.spec.serviceAccountName to a restricted SA (create a dedicated
redis SA with minimal RBAC), add spec.template.spec.securityContext with
runAsNonRoot: true and fsGroup (e.g., 1000) so /data is writable, and in the
container securityContext set runAsUser (non-root UID),
allowPrivilegeEscalation: false, capabilities: drop: ["ALL"],
readOnlyRootFilesystem: false (since Redis needs /data) and seccompProfile: {
type: RuntimeDefault }; ensure the SA and any PSP/PSP-replacement (PodSecurity
admission) policies permit these constraints.

```text
In docs/01_product_roadmap.md around lines 34 to 39, the roadmap dates list RC
and GA without mapping which CI checks/gates must pass; update the roadmap to
enumerate the required checks and link them to the Release Plan and CI jobs.
Specifically, add a short checklist under the RC/GA entries naming the exact CI
jobs that must be green (unit, integration, e2e-with-redis, security-scan,
performance-smoke, deploy-preview), reference the canonical release-plan
file/path and the CI workflow file(s) (e.g., .github/workflows/release.yml), and
note any gating rules (e.g., “all listed jobs must pass and branch protection
enabled”) so the roadmap dates align with the Release Plan and CI gates.

### docs/TUI/README.md:21

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In docs/TUI/README.md around lines 15 to 21, the README shows verified images
but is missing a short "How to build/run TUI" snippet; add a brief section
titled "How to build/run TUI" that states the command to run the TUI (make
run-tui) and a one-line note that referenced SVGs are in docs/TUI/images and the
Makefile target is defined (Makefile:19–20), so users can build and run the
interface easily.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 8 | Added a concise "How to build/run TUI" section that points to the supported Makefile target. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Design docs benefit from including the one command that gets contributors into the experience quickly.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Documented the `make run-tui` target, explained what it builds, and pointed readers to the SVG assets directory for mockups.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> I cross-checked the instructions with the Makefile target so future edits stay aligned with the canonical entrypoint.

> None.

### Makefile:13

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In Makefile around line 13, remove the unnecessary GO111MODULE=on prefix from
the go build command and ensure the linker variable used in LDFLAGS exists:
either add a package-level variable in package main (e.g. in cmd/$(APP)/main.go
declare var version string) so -X main.version=$(VERSION) will succeed, or
change the -X flag to point to the actual package and symbol that holds the
version; then run the build to confirm the "Missing main.version symbol for -X"
error is resolved.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 7 | Dropped the unused GO111MODULE env and confirmed the linker flag resolves against the existing `main.version` symbol. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Keeping Makefile defaults aligned with the current Go toolchain avoids redundant env overrides and surprise warnings.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Removed the legacy `GO111MODULE=on` prefix from the primary build target and verified that the `cmd/job-queue-system` main package already exposes the `version` variable required by `-X main.version`.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> Build scripts rely on the module defaults now, so future Go upgrades won't inherit stale environment flags.
>
> ## Notes
>
> None.

### Makefile:18

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In Makefile around lines 16 to 18, the TUI build target uses a different go
build invocation than the other build targets; make it consistent by using the
same variables and flags as the other builds: ensure the target creates the bin
directory if needed and invoke go build with the shared GOFLAGS and LDFLAGS
(e.g. use GO111MODULE=on go build $(GOFLAGS) -ldflags "$(LDFLAGS)" -o bin/tui
./cmd/tui) so the TUI is built with the same environment and linker flags as the
rest of the project.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 8 | Unified the TUI build recipe with the primary binary and added the missing version symbol so LDFLAGS apply cleanly. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Duplicated build recipes drift quickly; centralizing on shared variables keeps the binaries in lockstep.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Introduced reusable `BIN_DIR`/`GOFLAGS` helpers, ensured the target creates `bin/`, mirrored the linker flags, and added a `version` variable to `cmd/tui/main.go` so the `-X main.version` injection succeeds.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> Both binaries now rely on the same Makefile plumbing, so adding flags or changing linker settings will propagate automatically.
>
> ## Notes
>
> None.

### .githooks/pre-commit:15

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In .githooks/pre-commit around lines 7 to 15, the hook assumes python3 exists
and will fail if it's absent; update it to detect an available interpreter at
runtime by checking for "python3" first, then "python" (using quoted paths), and
if neither exists either exit with a clear error message or skip the progress
update gracefully; use the detected interpreter variable when invoking
scripts/update_progress.py and ensure git add only runs when the update
succeeded.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 8 | Hook now discovers python3/python dynamically and exits early if neither exists. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Pre-commit tooling should degrade with clear messaging when platform dependencies are missing.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Added interpreter discovery logic that prefers `python3`, falls back to `python`, and surfaces an actionable error when both are absent before running the progress script.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> The hook keeps using `set -e`, so any failure in interpreter detection or script execution halts the commit safely.
>
> ## Notes
>
> None.

### .github/workflows/update-progress.yml:6

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In .github/workflows/update-progress.yml lines 1-6, YAMLLint flagged the
reserved key and bracket spacing: wrap the reserved key "on" in quotes (e.g.
"on":) and tighten the branch list brackets by removing inner spaces and quoting
the value (e.g. branches: ['main']) so the YAML parses cleanly.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 9 | Quoted the reserved `on` key and normalized the branches list to satisfy YAML linters. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> GitHub Actions still needs quoting for reserved words; keeping lint feedback in mind avoids CI churn.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Updated the workflow header to wrap `on` in quotes and tightened the push branches array to `['main']` as suggested.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> YAMLlint now passes on this section, so future formatting checks won't flag the reserved key.
>
> ## Notes
>
> None.

### .github/workflows/update-progress.yml:10

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In .github/workflows/update-progress.yml around lines 8 to 10, the workflow
lacks concurrency control which allows overlapping runs on rapid pushes; add a
top-level concurrency block (e.g., concurrency: { group: 'update-progress-${{
github.ref }}', cancel-in-progress: true }) to serialize runs per branch/ref and
cancel any in-progress run when a new one starts; place this block at the same
indentation level as permissions and jobs.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 9 | Added a concurrency block so only one update-progress run executes per ref. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Serializing automation jobs prevents the GitHub Actions queue from thrashing on fast pushes.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Declared a top-level concurrency group keyed by `github.ref` and enabled `cancel-in-progress` to ensure newer pushes replace in-flight runs.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> Future tweaks to this workflow inherit the concurrency gate because it sits alongside `permissions` and `jobs`.
>
> ## Notes
>
> None.

### .github/workflows/update-progress.yml:41

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
.github/workflows/update-progress.yml lines 31-41: the workflow uses unguarded
git add and unquoted $GITHUB_OUTPUT redirections; update the script to first
check for the presence of the files (or use a safe add that won’t fail) before
running git add, and ensure all instances of >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT are changed to >>
"$GITHUB_OUTPUT" (quote the variable) so the redirection target is not
word-split; keep behavior the same otherwise (commit only when changes exist).
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 8 | Hardened the commit step to quote `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` and only add files that exist. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Guarding automation scripts against missing files prevents noisy failures when outputs are unchanged.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Collected the files to add conditionally, skipped `git add` when none are present, and wrapped all output writes with quotes to avoid word splitting.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> The array approach keeps the add list explicit, so future additions can extend it without breaking empty runs.
>
> ## Notes
>
> None.

### .github/workflows/update-progress.yml:47

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
.github/workflows/update-progress.yml around lines 43-47 contains an extra
trailing blank line after the git push step; remove the empty line after the
final "git push" run block so the file ends immediately after the command (no
extra newline line), keeping YAML lint happy.

### cmd/job-queue-system/main.go:92

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In cmd/job-queue-system/main.go around lines 85 to 92, the code always starts
the observability HTTP server (metrics/healthz/readyz) even for role=admin; this
can cause unnecessary port conflicts for one-shot admin commands. Modify the
logic to only call obs.StartHTTPServer and defer its Shutdown when the
configured role is not "admin" (e.g., if cfg.Role != "admin" or a bool IsAdmin
check is false); otherwise skip starting the HTTP server entirely. Ensure
readyCheck remains defined for non-admin paths and that no server is started or
shutdown deferred when running as admin.

### cmd/job-queue-system/main.go:114

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In cmd/job-queue-system/main.go around lines 112–114, the background metrics
updater is started unconditionally for CLI/admin paths; guard the
obs.StartQueueLengthUpdater call so it is skipped when running the admin/CLI
mode. Change the code to check an existing config flag (e.g. cfg.Admin or
cfg.IsAdmin) or add a new flag like cfg.DisableBackgroundUpdaters/DisableMetrics
and only call obs.StartQueueLengthUpdater when that flag is false; ensure the
updater is not launched for admin CLI invocations.

### cmd/job-queue-system/main.go:149

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In cmd/job-queue-system/main.go around lines 142 to 149, the admin handling is
nested inside the switch's default branch which obscures flow and risks
accidental execution when new roles are added; refactor by branching early or
adding an explicit case for "admin" instead of placing it in default: move the
admin check before the switch or add a dedicated case "admin" that calls
runAdmin(...) and returns, and keep the default branch solely to log/exit on
unknown roles so control flow is clear and future role additions won't
accidentally run admin logic.
```

### cmd/job-queue-system/main.go:188

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In cmd/job-queue-system/main.go around lines 187-188, the purge-all branch
prints a human-readable string with fmt.Printf which is inconsistent with other
admin commands that emit machine-readable JSON; replace the fmt.Printf call with
code that outputs a JSON object (e.g. {"purged": n}) to stdout using the
encoding/json package (or fmt.Fprintf with a properly escaped JSON string) and
ensure it ends with a newline and returns the same exit path as other admin
outputs.

In deployments/kubernetes/rbac-monitoring.yaml around line 35 (and also review
lines 78, 88, 99, 109, 120, 130, 140, 151, 161, 172, 182), the Prometheus alert
expressions reference non-existent rbac_* metrics and job="rbac-token-service";
either register the missing rbac_* metrics in the RBAC token service (create and
MustRegister prometheus metrics, instrument code, and expose them on /metrics)
or update the YAML alerts to reference actual metric names we already export
(e.g., jobs_*, backpressure_*, exactly_once_*) and/or ensure Prometheus scrape
configs include a target with job="rbac-token-service" so
up{job="rbac-token-service"} is valid; choose one approach and make consistent
changes across all listed lines.

### Dockerfile:3

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In Dockerfile around line 3, the build stage uses golang:1.23 while CI/docs
require Go 1.25; update the builder image tag to golang:1.25 to align
toolchains. Edit the FROM line to use golang:1.25 (or the exact patch variant
your CI/doc specify) so the compile environment matches CI/docs, then rebuild
and run CI to verify no compatibility issues.

### docs/15_promotion_checklists.md:33

- [ ] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In docs/15_promotion_checklists.md around lines 21–33, the promotion checklist
table is missing OWNER and EXIT CRITERIA columns which prevents enforceable
gates; add two new columns "OWNER" and "EXIT CRITERIA" to the table header and
for each row populate a responsible owner (GitHub handle or team) and a clear,
testable exit criterion (e.g., "E2E pass 5× in CI", ">=80% coverage on admin &
obs", "alert rules merged + helm docs") and update any status cells accordingly
so CI can validate these criteria; also add a short note under the table
describing how CI will read these columns (OWNER format and exact phrasing
required for automated checks).

- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In docs/api/admin-api.md around lines 41 to 44, the configuration shows a single
confirmation_phrase while the endpoints require different phrases (e.g.,
CONFIRM_DELETE_ALL) causing inconsistency; choose one approach and make docs and
code consistent: either document separate keys (e.g., dlq_confirmation_phrase
and purge_all_confirmation_phrase) and update the sample config and README to
list both keys, or change the endpoints to validate against the single
configured confirmation_phrase and update any endpoint docs/samples to reference
that single key; apply the chosen change across the docs and codebase so the
config keys and endpoint expectations match.

- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In docs/api/admin-api.md around lines 106 to 132, the queue parameter
description is ambiguous about alias-to-Redis-key mappings; update the docs to
explicitly list accepted aliases (high, low, completed, dead_letter) and show
the exact Redis key each alias resolves to (or state that a full Redis key may
be provided), and reference the configuration fields that control those mappings
by name (worker.queues.* for priority queues, completed_list for completed jobs,
dead_letter_list for dead-letter queue). Mention accepted value formats (alias
or full Redis key) and provide a short example mapping table or inline examples
referencing the config keys so readers know where to change the mappings.

```text
In docs/api/admin-api.md around lines 260 to 268, the CORS guidance currently
implies using cors_allow_origins: ["*"]; update the text to recommend an empty
list as the safe default and explicitly warn that using "*" is dangerous when
require_auth: true. Replace the current bullet with instructions to set
cors_allow_origins to an explicit, environment-specific list of allowed origins
(or leave empty to block cross-origin requests), add a short note discouraging
"*" for authenticated endpoints, and include a brief recommendation to use
specific subdomains or environment variables for allowed origins and to test
CORS in staging before production.

docs/api/event-hooks.md around lines 110 to 124: the HMAC signature currently
only covers the body which allows replay attacks because the listed
X-Webhook-Timestamp is not bound to the signature; update the docs to require
that the signature is computed over a canonical string that includes the
timestamp (e.g., timestamp + "." + body) and that receivers verify the timestamp
is within a configurable freshness window (e.g., ±N seconds) before accepting
the signature, and document that the server must reject deliveries with
missing/old timestamps or mismatched signatures.

```text
In docs/api/event-hooks.md around lines 246 to 264, the docs currently describe
rate limiting and retry policy but do not document idempotency or replay
semantics for DLH replays; add a short subsection stating that replays may
duplicate deliveries and receivers must treat deliveries as potentially
repeated, require an idempotency header (e.g., X-Webhook-Delivery) containing a
unique delivery ID, and optionally include a replay indicator (e.g.,
X-Webhook-Replay: true). Explain receiver behavior: persist the delivery ID with
a configurable TTL, deduplicate by returning a successful 2xx response for
already-processed IDs, use the idempotency key to make non-idempotent operations
safe (skip or noop on duplicate IDs), and document recommended TTL and retention
guidance for the idempotency cache.

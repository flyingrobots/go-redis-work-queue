### deployments/docker/docker-compose.yaml:53

- [x] Fixed
- [ ] Test Written
- [ ] Suggestion Ignored

```text
In deployments/docker/docker-compose.yaml around lines 50 to 53, the healthcheck
uses wget which may not exist in minimal base images; replace it with a portable
curl invocation or run the check via CMD-SHELL so the shell builtin or installed
tools can be used. Update the test to use something like: use curl --fail
--silent --show-error http://localhost:8080/health (or wrap the existing wget in
a CMD-SHELL call) and keep interval/timeout/retries unchanged to ensure the
container healthcheck works across base images.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 8 | Healthcheck now uses curl with fail-fast flags, avoiding wget dependency. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Compose healthchecks should rely on tools already baked into the container image and fail loudly.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Swapped the admin API service healthcheck to `curl --fail --silent --show-error --max-time 3 http://localhost:8080/health`, keeping timing settings unchanged.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> Align compose healthchecks with the Dockerfile toolchain (curl now installed in the runtime layer).
>
> ## Notes

> Manual verification only; compose stack not executed here.

```text
In deployments/docker/docker-compose.yaml around lines 86–106 (Prometheus) and
98–113 (Grafana), stop using :latest — pin Prometheus and Grafana images to
specific immutable versions (replace prom/prometheus:latest and
grafana/grafana:latest with chosen version tags), add a restart policy line
(restart: unless-stopped) to both service blocks, and resolve the missing
dashboards path referenced for Grafana by either adding the dashboards JSON
files under deployments/docker/grafana/dashboards or updating the Grafana
volumes entry to point to the correct existing dashboards directory.
```

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 7 | Prometheus/Grafana now use pinned images, restart policies, and real provisioning files. |

> Compose examples need deterministic images and actual provisioning assets so newcomers can run them verbatim.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> Pinned Prometheus to `v2.53.1`, Grafana to `10.4.1`, added `restart: unless-stopped`, and created `deployments/docker/grafana/{dashboards,datasources}` with sample dashboard + datasource to satisfy the mounted paths.

```text
In deployments/docker/rbac-configs/resources.yaml around lines 91 to 205 the
actions catalog is missing actions referenced by roles (metrics:read,
health:read) and contains an ambiguous queues:list entry; add explicit action
definitions for "metrics:read" and "health:read" mirroring the pattern
(description, risk_level, audit_required) used elsewhere, and resolve the
queues:list ambiguity by either removing "queues:list" from the catalog and all
roles or by explicitly mapping "queues:list" to the same internal capability as
"queues:read" (documenting it in the description) so semantics are not
duplicated or ambiguous.

monitoring.permissions either add missing actions "metrics:read" and
"health:read" to deployments/docker/rbac-configs/resources.yaml or map them to

replace "admin:all" and "emergency:*" with explicit actions (for example
admin:users, admin:tokens, admin:audit, admin:system, queues:delete, dlq:purge)

change emergency.resource_constraints.conditions to reference schedules defined
in resources.yaml (e.g., schedule: "emergency_only" or "after_hours") rather

roles.yaml exists under actions in resources.yaml.

In docs/FEATURE_ENHANCEMENT_AGENT_PROMPT.md around lines 32 to 35, the
admonition uses a non-standard collapsible syntax (`> [!note]- **🗣️ CLAUDE'S
THOUGHTS 💭**`) which may not render across Markdown processors; replace it with
standard Markdown (e.g., a heading or blockquote) or explicitly document the
required Markdown extension, and update the template to use a portable pattern
such as a level-3 heading "### 🗣️ CLAUDE'S THOUGHTS" or a standard blockquote
starting with "> **🗣️ CLAUDE'S THOUGHTS:**" so rendering is consistent.

```text
In docs/FEATURE_ENHANCEMENT_AGENT_PROMPT.md around lines 156–180 the color
palette is embedded as an XML-style comment block which is not machine-friendly
or easily reusable; extract the palette into a proper config (e.g.,
docs/colors.yml or docs/colors.json) listing named roles and hex values, replace
the XML comment in the markdown with either a compact markdown table pointing to
the new config file or a brief reference link, and ensure each entry includes a
clear role key (background/panel/border/text/button) and hex value so downstream
code/docs can import or reference it.

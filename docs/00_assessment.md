# Current State Assessment

- Last updated: 2025-09-12

## Executive Summary
The project has a working foundation: a single Go binary with producer, worker, reaper, circuit breaker, configuration, logging, metrics, optional tracing, tests, and CI. To reach a production-grade v1.0.0, we need to harden prioritization semantics, improve observability depth, finalize graceful recovery edge cases, add health endpoints, enhance documentation, and conduct performance and failure-mode testing.

## Current Implementation
- Modes: `--role=producer|worker|all` with YAML config and env overrides.
- Redis: go-redis v8 with dynamic pool, retries, timeouts.
- Queues: priority lists (`high`, `low`), per-worker processing list, completed and dead-letter lists.
- Worker: BRPOPLPUSH per-queue with short timeout to emulate priority; heartbeat via `SET ... EX`.
- Reaper: scans `jobqueue:worker:*:processing` when heartbeat missing and requeues payloads.
- Circuit breaker: Closed/Open/HalfOpen with sliding window and cooldown; metrics for state.
- Observability: Prometheus `/metrics`, zap logs; optional OTLP tracing.
- Tests: unit tests for breaker, config, queue, worker flows; integration with miniredis.
- CI: GitHub Actions build + race tests.

## What’s Working
- End-to-end enqueue → consume → complete/ retry/ DLQ → requeue on orphaned processing.
- Graceful shutdown using contexts with signal handling.
- Configurable backoff and retry behavior.
- Baseline observability metrics and structured logs.

## Gaps vs. Spec
- Prioritized blocking dequeue across multiple queues: current approach loops BRPOPLPUSH per-queue with small timeouts. Spec implies multi-queue blocking pop with atomic move. Redis lacks native multi-source BRPOPLPUSH; we will document and validate current approach, and optionally add a Lua-assisted non-blocking RPOPLPUSH sweep to reduce latency.
- Queue length gauges: not yet periodically updated.
- Health/readiness endpoint: missing.
- Tracing: job TraceID/SpanID not yet used to create spans; only tracing setup exists.
- Configuration validation and schema doc: defaults exist; explicit validation and error messages to add.
- Rate limiter: basic fixed-window; needs jitter/backoff and precise sleep to next window for high QPS bursts.
- Operational tooling: admin CLI (peek queue, purge DLQ, show stats) not yet implemented.
- Performance validation: load tests and tuning for pool sizes and timeouts remain.

## Technical Debt
- Emulated priority fetch could be improved or justified formally.
- Reaper scans by processing lists; ensure worst-case behavior with many workers is efficient (SCAN pacing and limits).
- Simulated processing; provide pluggable processor interface.
- Configurable metrics cardinality controls and labels.

## Immediate Priorities
1. Add health/readiness probe and queue length updater.
2. Use TraceID/SpanID to start spans and enrich logs.
3. Strengthen rate limiter timing and jitter; document guarantees.
4. Add config validation and error reporting.
5. Write e2e tests with real Redis (service container) and performance benchmarks.

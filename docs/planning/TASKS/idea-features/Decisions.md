# Design Decisions Log

## Decision 1: Feature Prioritization Strategy

### Context
37 feature ideas need to be prioritized for implementation with limited resources.

### Options Considered

#### Option A: Implement all features in parallel
- **Pros**: Fast delivery, maximum parallelization
- **Cons**: Resource conflicts, quality risks, integration challenges
- **Estimated Effort**: 6 months with 10 developers

#### Option B: Strict sequential implementation
- **Pros**: Low risk, easy to manage
- **Cons**: Very slow delivery, no parallelization benefits
- **Estimated Effort**: 18 months with 2 developers

#### Option C: Priority-based waves with resource constraints (SELECTED)
- **Pros**: Balanced risk/speed, respects dependencies, allows parallelization
- **Cons**: Complex coordination required
- **Estimated Effort**: 8 months with 4 developers
- **Rationale**: Optimizes for both speed and quality while respecting technical dependencies

### Implementation Notes
- P1 features (foundations) in early waves
- P2 features (core capabilities) in middle waves
- P3/P4 features (enhancements) in later waves
- Resource conflicts resolved via wave separation

## Decision 2: Reuse Strategy for Existing Components

### Context
Significant existing codebase with Redis, TUI, and queue implementations.

### Options Considered

#### Option A: Rewrite everything for consistency
- **Pros**: Clean architecture, no legacy constraints
- **Cons**: Massive effort, throws away working code
- **Estimated Effort**: +200% time

#### Option B: Wrapper pattern for all existing code
- **Pros**: Clean interfaces, gradual migration
- **Cons**: Additional abstraction layers, performance overhead
- **Estimated Effort**: +50% time

#### Option C: Direct extension of existing components (SELECTED)
- **Pros**: Maximum reuse, minimal overhead, faster delivery
- **Cons**: Must work within existing patterns
- **Estimated Effort**: Baseline
- **Rationale**: Existing components are well-tested and performant

### Implementation Notes
- Extend internal/tui for all UI features
- Reuse internal/redis_client for all Redis operations
- Leverage internal/queue for job management
- Build on internal/obs for metrics

## Decision 3: Testing Strategy

### Context
Need comprehensive testing while maintaining velocity.

### Options Considered

#### Option A: 100% coverage requirement
- **Pros**: Maximum quality assurance
- **Cons**: Slows development significantly
- **Estimated Effort**: +40% time per feature

#### Option B: No formal testing requirements
- **Pros**: Fastest initial delivery
- **Cons**: Technical debt, production issues
- **Estimated Effort**: -20% initially, +100% for fixes

#### Option C: 80% coverage for P1/P2, 60% for P3/P4 (SELECTED)
- **Pros**: Balanced quality/speed, risk-based approach
- **Cons**: Some features less thoroughly tested
- **Estimated Effort**: +20% time per feature
- **Rationale**: Critical features get thorough testing, nice-to-haves get basic coverage

### Implementation Notes
- P1 features: Unit + Integration + E2E tests
- P2 features: Unit + Integration tests
- P3/P4 features: Unit tests only
- Shared test Redis instances for efficiency

## Decision 4: Resource Conflict Resolution

### Context
Multiple features require exclusive access to shared resources.

### Options Considered

#### Option A: First-come-first-served
- **Pros**: Simple to implement
- **Cons**: May block critical features
- **Estimated Impact**: Random delays

#### Option B: Priority-based queueing
- **Pros**: Critical features get resources first
- **Cons**: Complex scheduling logic
- **Estimated Impact**: Predictable but complex

#### Option C: Wave separation with sequential ordering (SELECTED)
- **Pros**: Simple, predictable, no runtime conflicts
- **Cons**: May increase total timeline
- **Estimated Impact**: +10% total time
- **Rationale**: Eliminates runtime resource conflicts entirely

### Implementation Notes
- Redis schema changes in separate waves
- TUI modifications sequential within waves
- Test resources pooled with capacity limits
- Configuration changes atomic per wave

## Decision 5: Logging and Observability Standard

### Context
Need consistent logging across all features for debugging and monitoring.

### Options Considered

#### Option A: Free-form logging
- **Pros**: Flexible, developer-friendly
- **Cons**: Hard to parse, inconsistent
- **Impact**: Poor observability

#### Option B: Structured logging with custom format
- **Pros**: Consistent, parseable
- **Cons**: Need custom tooling
- **Impact**: Medium effort, good results

#### Option C: JSON Lines standard format (SELECTED)
- **Pros**: Industry standard, tool support, consistent
- **Cons**: Slightly verbose
- **Impact**: Low effort, excellent results
- **Rationale**: Wide tool support, easy parsing, standard format

### Implementation Notes
- Required fields: timestamp, task_id, step, status, message
- Optional fields: percent, data
- One JSON object per line
- Status values: start, progress, done, error

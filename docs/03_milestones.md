# Milestones

- Status: Actively maintained

## Executive Summary

Milestones define concrete deliverables with success criteria, dependencies, and decision gates. They map to the alpha, beta, RC, and GA releases; timelines are flexible and driven by readiness rather than fixed dates.

## Milestone List

1. Health + Validation
   - Status: Active
   - Owner/DRI: Jamie Patel (Platform Lead, @jamie) — Backup: Priya Shah (QA Lead, @priya)
   - Responsibility: ship health/readiness endpoints and config validation; green-light go/no-go review
   - Deliverables: `/healthz` and `/readyz` endpoints; strict config validation with errors; docs updated
   - Success: endpoints return 200; malformed configs fail with descriptive messages
2. Observability Depth
   - Status: Queued (starts after Milestone 1)
   - Owner/DRI: Alice Nguyen (Observability, @alice) — Backup: Daniel Reed (SRE, @daniel)
   - Responsibility: ensure metrics/traces meet dashboards + alerting acceptance criteria
   - Deliverables: queue length gauges updated every 2s; TraceID/SpanID used for spans and logs
   - Success: metrics visible under load; traces exported when enabled
3. Alpha Ship
   - Status: Queued
   - Owner/DRI: Morgan Lee (Release Manager, @morgan) — Backup: Priya Shah (QA Lead, @priya)
   - Responsibility: coordinate tag, release notes, and promotion checklist sign-off
   - Deliverables: v0.4.0 tag; CHANGELOG; release notes
   - Success: CI green; basic load test at 500 jobs/min sustained
4. Admin Tooling + Rate Limiter
   - Status: Planned
   - Owner/DRI: Rafael Torres (Runtime, @rafael) — Backup: Erin Zhao (Product, @erin)
   - Responsibility: validate admin flows and limiter guardrails across environments
   - Deliverables: `stats`, `peek`, `purge-dlq` CLI; limiter jitter + precise window sleep
   - Success: commands operate safely; limiter smooths bursts; docs updated
5. E2E + Perf Baseline
   - Status: Planned
   - Owner/DRI: Carol Smith (Perf Guild, @carol) — Backup: Ethan Wu (Perf Eng, @ethan)
   - Responsibility: capture baseline metrics and document tuning guidance
   - Deliverables: real Redis service container tests; perf doc; pool sizing guidance
   - Success: 1k jobs/min on 4 vCPU passes with p95 < 2s small files
6. RC Ship + Chaos
   - Status: Planned
   - Owner/DRI: Priya Shah (QA Lead, @priya) — Backup: Morgan Lee (Release Manager, @morgan)
   - Responsibility: oversee chaos campaign, security checks, and RC readiness sign-off
   - Deliverables: chaos tests; security checks in CI; RC release v0.9.0
   - Success: automatic recovery from injected failures; zero critical vulns
7. GA
   - Status: Planned
   - Owner/DRI: Morgan Lee (Release Manager, @morgan) — Backup: Alice Nguyen (Observability, @alice)
   - Responsibility: coordinate GA launch, docs, and final SLO validation
   - Deliverables: docs and ops runbook; GA release; example deploy assets
   - Success: zero P0/P1 issues; CI green across matrix

## Dependencies

- 2 depends on 1 (observability requires validated config and endpoints)
- 3 depends on 1-2 (Alpha ship waits on health, validation, and observability depth)
- 5 depends on 4 (perf needs stabilized limiter and tools)
- 6 depends on 5 (chaos built on validated e2e)
- 7 depends on 6 (GA after RC validation)

## Go/No-Go Decision Gates

- Alpha: must meet milestone 1–3 success criteria and exit code freeze with clean security scans (`govulncheck` clean, no High/Critical CVEs).
- Beta: limiter behavior validated, admin tools safe, perf doc drafted, security scans clean.
- RC: chaos tests pass, no critical security findings, doc set reviewed.
- GA: p95 < 2s small files, SLOs defined, docs complete, security gates clean.

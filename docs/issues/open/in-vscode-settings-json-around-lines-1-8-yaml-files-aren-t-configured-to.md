In .vscode/settings.json around lines 1-8, YAML files aren't configured to
format or fix on save; add a "[yaml]" settings block (or ensure the "yaml"
language id is used) with "editor.formatOnSave": true and, if desired,
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": { "source.fixAll": true } (or other preferred code
action) so YAML manifests/CI are automatically formatted and fixed on save;
optionally reference the YAML extension if your workspace relies on it.

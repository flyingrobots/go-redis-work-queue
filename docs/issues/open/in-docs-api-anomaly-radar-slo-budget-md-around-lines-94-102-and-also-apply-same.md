In docs/api/anomaly-radar-slo-budget.md around lines 94-102 (and also apply same
change at lines 193-199), the struct fields lack explicit units and valid
ranges; update the struct comments to include units and ranges (e.g.,
BacklogGrowthWarning/BacklogGrowthCritical: "items/second";
ErrorRateWarning/ErrorRateCritical: "0â€“1"; LatencyP95Warning/LatencyP95Critical:
"ms"), and add a concise explanatory table or short paragraph immediately
beneath the struct and its JSON examples that lists each field, its unit, and
valid range so readers and JSON consumers have clear expectations.

In docs/api/admin-api.md around lines 82-84 (and also at 99-106 and 139-146),
the queue name examples in the TOC (e.g., "jobqueue:high") do not match the
mapping table (which uses "jobqueue:high_priority"); pick one canonical name and
make all examples consistent: update the TOC examples to use the mapping table
names OR rename the mapping entries to match the TOC, and then replace every
mismatched occurrence at the three specified ranges so the sample keys and the
mapping table are identical.

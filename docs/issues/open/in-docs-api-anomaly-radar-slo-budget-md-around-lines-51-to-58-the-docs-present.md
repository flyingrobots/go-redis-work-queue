In docs/api/anomaly-radar-slo-budget.md around lines 51 to 58, the docs present
two conflicting collector APIs (closures-based SimpleMetricsCollector and an
interface-based QueueMetricsCollector); remove the closures-based
SimpleMetricsCollector snippet and keep the interface-based approach, add an
explicit MetricCollector interface signature description immediately before the
QueueMetricsCollector example so readers see the expected methods and types;
repeat the same cleanup for the other occurrence around lines 446â€“470 by
deleting the closure example and ensuring the interface signature is documented
prior to the QueueMetricsCollector sample.

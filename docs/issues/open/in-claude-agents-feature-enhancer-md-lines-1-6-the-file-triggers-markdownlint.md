```text
In .claude/agents/feature-enhancer.md lines 1-6, the file triggers markdownlint
rule MD013 (line length); either reflow the long description lines to reasonable
lengths (wrap paragraphs or break the long single-line description into multiple
shorter lines) or explicitly disable the rule for this file by adding <!--
markdownlint-disable MD013 --> at the top before the content and then add <!--
markdownlint-enable MD013 --> at EOF to re-enable the rule; ensure no other
lines exceed the project's max line length if you choose wrapping.

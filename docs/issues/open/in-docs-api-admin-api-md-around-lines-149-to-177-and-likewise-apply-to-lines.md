```text
In docs/api/admin-api.md around lines 149 to 177 (and likewise apply to lines
179 to 200), the minimum reason length (10 characters) is repeated inline; add a
single clear line such as "Minimum reason length: 10 characters" immediately
before each relevant endpoint description and update the purge-all reference to
point to that line so both endpoints reference the same minimum-length statement
rather than duplicating the rule.

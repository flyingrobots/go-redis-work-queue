AGENTS.md lines 828-830: the second "APPENDIX B: WILD IDEAS — HAVE A BRAINSTORM"
heading is a duplicate and should be removed; delete this repeated heading (and
any immediately duplicated anchor/ID) so only the original Appendix B remains,
or if those lines introduce unique content, merge that content under the first
Appendix B heading and remove the duplicate anchor to ensure no duplicate
anchors exist.

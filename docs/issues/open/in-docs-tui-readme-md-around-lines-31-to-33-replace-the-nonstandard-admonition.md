In docs/TUI/README.md around lines 31 to 33, replace the nonstandard admonition
marker `[!note]-` with a GitHub-friendly pattern: either a simple blockquote
starting with "Note:" (e.g. `> **Note:** ...`) or a section header like `####
Note` (or remove the admonition entirely); apply the same change to all other
occurrences in this file so linters/renderers no longer fail on the `[!note]-`
syntax.
```

In docs/api/anomaly-radar-openapi.yaml around lines 386 to 393, the description
for the Go time.ParseDuration example currently shows a shorthand (e.g., 720h)
but our docs use canonical duration strings elsewhere; update the description to
include the canonical format (e.g., 720h0m0s) and, if appropriate, show both
short and canonical examples (e.g., "Go time.ParseDuration format (e.g., 720h or
720h0m0s)"), ensuring wording and examples match the project's canonical
duration style used in other docs.

In AGENTS.md around lines 791 to 828, there is a duplicated "## APPENDIX B: WILD
IDEAS — HAVE A BRAINSTORM" heading; remove the first/stray APPENDIX B block (the
one preceding the detailed NOTE and activity log) so only a single APPENDIX B
remains, and if you want to preserve the NOTE text, move that NOTE under the
Daily Activity Logs section instead of duplicating the appendix heading.

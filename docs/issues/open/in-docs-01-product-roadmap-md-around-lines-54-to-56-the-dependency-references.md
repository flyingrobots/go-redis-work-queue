In docs/01_product_roadmap.md around lines 54 to 56, the dependency references
use placeholder PR numbers (#123, #145, #130); replace each stub PR reference
with the actual PR number or a direct link to the corresponding doc/issue before
GA (or change to the appropriate document link anchor), and ensure owner names
remain intact; update the three lines so each dependency points to a real,
resolvable reference (PR URL or docs link) or remove the PR token if no final
reference exists.

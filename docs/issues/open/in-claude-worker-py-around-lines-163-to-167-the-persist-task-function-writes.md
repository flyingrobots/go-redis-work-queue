In claude_worker.py around lines 163 to 167 the _persist_task function writes
JSON to disk but does not flush and fsync, risking loss on crash; modify the
function to open the file, write the JSON, call handle.flush() and
os.fsync(handle.fileno()) before closing, ensure parent directories are created
as before, and keep encoding="utf-8"; also handle exceptions if desired and
avoid changing the function signature.

the recommendations are high-level and lack ownership and measurable follow-up;
add an "Action Items" section listing each recommendation as a checkboxed task
with an assigned owner, clear acceptance criteria, and a deadline (e.g., owner:
@username, acceptance: what success looks like, due: YYYY-MM-DD). Convert each
bullet into an actionable item (stabilize shared test infra; add lightweight
signals; define prerequisite chains), and add a final line offering to draft the
issue and PR templates (or link to them) so someone can immediately pick this
up. Ensure formatting is consistent with the doc (checkboxes, owner, acceptance
criteria, deadline) so these items are testable and trackable.

In docs/SLAPS/worker-reflections/claude-006-reflection.md around lines 8 to 12,
the file duplicates the date in the body which may drift; remove the "Date:
September 14, 2025" line (or alternatively remove the front-matter date) so
there is a single canonical source of truth, and update the file to render the
date from front matter (or keep only the body date) and delete the redundant
body line.

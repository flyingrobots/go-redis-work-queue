In docs/SLAPS/FINAL-POSTMORTEM.md around lines 433-434, the statement "Test
Coverage Achieved: 85%+ average" is ambiguous; replace it with a precise,
verifiable sentence that specifies the scope and measurement — list the
packages/modules included (placeholder: [PACKAGES]), the exact commit hash used
for the measurement (placeholder: [COMMIT_HASH]), the exact test/coverage
command run (placeholder: [COMMAND]), the coverage metric type
(line/statement/branch) and threshold (placeholder: [METRIC_TYPE] [THRESHOLD]),
the date/time of the run (placeholder: [DATE]), and a link or path to the
coverage artifact/report (placeholder: [ARTIFACT_URL_OR_PATH]); format it as a
single clear sentence using those placeholders so maintainers can replace them
with real values.

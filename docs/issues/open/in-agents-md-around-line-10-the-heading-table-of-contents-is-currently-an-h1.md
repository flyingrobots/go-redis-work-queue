```text
In AGENTS.md around line 10, the heading "Table of Contents" is currently an H1
which duplicates the document's main H1; change it to an H2 (replace leading "#
" with "## "), ensure there is a blank line before and after the new H2 per
Markdown conventions, and verify the file retains only a single H1 (the document
title) elsewhere.

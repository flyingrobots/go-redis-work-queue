In docs/SLAPS/FINAL-POSTMORTEM.md around line 20, the phrase "Zero
infrastructure" is misleading; replace it with "No distributed infra components"
(or equivalent) and update the surrounding sentence to reflect that local
filesystem operations plus tools like Git, directory watching, JSON tooling, and
Prometheus were used — not literally zero infrastructure. Search the document
for other occurrences of "Zero infrastructure" and update them consistently,
keeping the original meaning and tone.

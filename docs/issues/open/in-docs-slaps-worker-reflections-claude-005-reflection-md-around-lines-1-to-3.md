In docs/SLAPS/worker-reflections/claude-005-reflection.md around lines 1 to 3,
this markdown file is missing the YAML front-matter used by other reflections;
add a YAML block at the very top containing at least date and worker_id (e.g.,
date: YYYY-MM-DD and worker_id: claude-005) to match the pattern used by other
reflection files and ensure consistency across the docs.

bullets are generic and need concrete cross-references; update each bullet to
include a relative link or path to an example where you applied that strategy
(e.g., replace "Read Everything First" with "Read Everything First — review
notes: docs/reviews/P4.T044-notes.md", "Comprehensive Test Planning" with
"Comprehensive Test Planning — test plan: tests/plans/P4.T044.md", "Mermaid
Diagrams Everywhere" with "Mermaid Diagrams — diagram:
docs/diagrams/genealogy.mmd", and "Four-Part Adaptation Plan" with a pointer to
the workflow doc or task where you executed it), ensuring links are valid
relative paths and keep the bullet wording concise.

.claude/agents/feature-enhancer.md around lines 38 to 42: the file uses a
non-standard admonition "[!note]-" that won't render in portable Markdown;
replace it with a simple heading plus a blockquote. Change the admonition to a
heading like "### 🗣️ CLAUDE'S THOUGHTS" and move the instructional text into a

remains marked as markdown; update punctuation or dash characters as needed so
the output is valid Markdown and renders in common viewers.

.github/workflows/changelog.yml around lines 35 to 42: the workflow currently
sets git user.name/email to generic "github-actions" which can cause
DCO/ownership noise; update the git config to use the official GitHub Actions
bot identity by setting user.name to "github-actions[bot]" and user.email to
"41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com" before committing so
commits are attributed to the GitHub Actions bot.

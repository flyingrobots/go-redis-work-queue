```text
In dependency_analysis.py around lines 302 to 324, the "provides" entries are
currently copied verbatim while hard/soft/enables are normalized and aliased,
which can cause identifier mismatches; update the function to normalize and
resolve aliases for each item in the "provides" list the same way as the other
dependency lists (e.g., map each dep through normalize_name and resolve_alias)
or, if you intentionally want them only for display, add an explicit
comment/docstring near the function noting that "provides" is display-only and
must not be used for dependency resolution; choose one approach and apply it
consistently.

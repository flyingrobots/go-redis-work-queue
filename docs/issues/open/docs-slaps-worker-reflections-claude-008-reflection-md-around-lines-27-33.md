remove the vanity line-count mentions and replace them with direct links to the
real artifacts (architecture docs, OpenAPI 3.0 spec, JSON Schema definitions)
using repo-relative or absolute URLs; for each linked artifact add a one-line

design/architecture/job-genealogy.md — sections on algorithms and UX") and
ensure links point to the canonical files or rendered docs, not just folders.

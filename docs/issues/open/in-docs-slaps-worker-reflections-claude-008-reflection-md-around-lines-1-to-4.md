the front matter only contains date and worker_id; add explicit front-matter
fields required by the docs engine: title, slug, and description, and include a
mermaid: true/false toggle (or mermaid: enabled/disabled) as needed. Populate
title with a concise human-readable title, slug with a URL-safe identifier,
description with a one-line summary, and set the mermaid flag to the appropriate
boolean so the docs generator can parse and render diagrams.

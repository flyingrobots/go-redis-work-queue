In docs/api/anomaly-radar-slo-budget.md around line 124, there is no
machine-readable API spec; create an OpenAPI 3.1 YAML file that models all
endpoints, request/response schemas, parameters, auth, and example payloads
described in this doc, add it to the repo (e.g., docs/api/openapi.yaml), update
this markdown to link to that file and include a brief note on versioning, and
add a CI job (using OpenAPI Generator CLI or similar) that validates the spec
and generates client SDKs (specify targets, output directory, and caching) on
merge so clients are produced automatically.

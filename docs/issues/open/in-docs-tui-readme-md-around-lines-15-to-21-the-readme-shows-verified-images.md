In docs/TUI/README.md around lines 15 to 21, the README shows verified images
but is missing a short "How to build/run TUI" snippet; add a brief section
titled "How to build/run TUI" that states the command to run the TUI (make
run-tui) and a one-line note that referenced SVGs are in docs/TUI/images and the
Makefile target is defined (Makefile:19–20), so users can build and run the
interface easily.

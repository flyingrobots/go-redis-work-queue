high-level metrics presented without evidence; either remove or substantiate the
claims. Replace the standalone numbers with links to the concrete artifacts
(task lists, raw logs, LOC report, documentation index, API spec list, test
coverage report) or add footnotes/appendix subsections that embed/attach those
artifacts (paths, repo commits, CI artifacts, or generated reports), and if you
cannot provide verifiable sources remove the approximate figures and rewrite the
section to a qualitative summary without specific counts.

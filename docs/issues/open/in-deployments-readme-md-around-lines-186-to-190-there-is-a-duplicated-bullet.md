In deployments/README.md around lines 186 to 190 there is a duplicated bullet
"Prometheus metrics: Detailed health metrics"; remove the duplicate so the list
contains only one entry for Prometheus metrics (leave the other bullets
unchanged) and ensure spacing/formatting of the remaining list item matches the
surrounding bullets.

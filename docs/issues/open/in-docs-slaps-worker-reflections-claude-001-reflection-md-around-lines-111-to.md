114, the footer contains metadata as prose which is not machine-readable; move
each metadata item (end of reflection marker, total time in SLAPS, tasks
completed, primary lesson learned) into the document front-matter as explicit
fields (e.g., end_reflection, total_time, tasks_completed, primary_lesson) and
remove the corresponding footer lines at 111–114 so tooling can index the
values.

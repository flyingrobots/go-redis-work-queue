In docs/SLAPS/FINAL-POSTMORTEM.md around lines 50 to 51, the claim "WCAG
accessibility compliance" is vague; update the sentence to specify the exact
WCAG version and conformance level (e.g., "WCAG 2.2 Level AA") and list which
surfaces were audited (e.g., Theme Playground UI, built-in themes, color
contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and API responses). Replace the
generic phrase with a parenthetical or short clause like "(WCAG 2.2 AA; audited:
Theme Playground UI, six built-in themes for color contrast and keyboard/ARIA,
and public theme API endpoints)" and, if applicable, add a brief note on the
method (automated + manual audit) and date of audit.

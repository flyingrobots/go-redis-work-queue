In EVENT_HOOKS_TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md around lines 331 to 355, the example test
calls NewEventFilter() without showing required configuration or explaining
defaults; update the example to either (a) instantiate NewEventFilter with a
minimal, realistic config object used by the project (show required fields and
values inline) and use that instance in the test, or (b) if NewEventFilter
supports a no-arg/DefaultEventFilter, replace the call and comment that defaults
are used; ensure the example compiles and the t.Run block contains a concrete
assertion using that configured filter rather than a placeholder.

In README.md around lines 201 to 203, the docker compose command references the
wrong path (deploy/docker-compose.yml); update the command to point to the
actual file location deployments/docker/docker-compose.yaml (e.g. docker compose
-f deployments/docker/docker-compose.yaml up --build) so the documented command
works for users.

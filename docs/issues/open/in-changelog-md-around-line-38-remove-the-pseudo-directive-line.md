```text
In CHANGELOG.md around line 38, remove the pseudo‑directive line
"[request_verification]: Replace placeholder PR numbers with actual references
post-merge." from the user‑facing changelog; delete the entire line (or replace
it with an appropriate finalized reference or normal changelog entry) so
reviewer tags do not appear in public docs.

```text
In BUGS.md around lines 1-7 (and similarly lines 131-136), the tone is informal
and uses slang (“slaps”, “no‑BS”, “SLAPS swarm”) which is inappropriate for
engineering documentation; replace slang with neutral, precise language, remove
hype and persona, and rewrite the paragraphs as concise engineering statements
that describe features and the punch list plainly (e.g., list implemented
features and required next steps), keep factual details (BRPOPLPUSH,
heartbeat/reaper, priorities, DLQ, tests, metrics, config) but present them in a
bulleted or numbered, professional format and ensure tone is consistent
throughout the file.

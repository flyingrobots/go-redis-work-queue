```text
In AGENTS.md around lines 11 to 39 the TOC list blocks do not have blank lines
before and after them, triggering markdownlint MD032/MD022; fix by inserting a
blank line immediately before the start of the TOC list and a blank line
immediately after the closing list block (and any nested list blocks),
preserving existing indentation and content so each list is separated by a
single empty line.

.vscode/extensions.json around lines 2 to 7: the workspace recommendations list
lacks the cSpell extension even though a large cSpell dictionary is present in
settings; update the "recommendations" array to include the Spell Checker
extension ID ("streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker") so new contributors get
prompted to install it (and ensure it is not listed under
"unwantedRecommendations"); add the exact extension ID to the array and save the
file.

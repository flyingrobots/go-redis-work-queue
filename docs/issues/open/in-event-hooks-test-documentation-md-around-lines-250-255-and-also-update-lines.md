In EVENT_HOOKS_TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md around lines 250–255 (and also update lines
262–264), the Go version in the performance table is stale (shows "Go 1.22.5")
while the repo/CI/Docker use Go 1.25; change those occurrences to "Go 1.25" or
replace with an explicit reference to the repository/CI toolchain (e.g., "Go
1.25 (as specified in go.mod/GitHub Actions/Dockerfiles)") so the docs match the
actual toolchain.

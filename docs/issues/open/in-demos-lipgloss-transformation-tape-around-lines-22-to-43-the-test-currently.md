In demos/lipgloss-transformation.tape around lines 22 to 43, the test currently
sends many individual "Type"/"Enter" steps for static text which is slow and
brittle; replace that sequence with a single Paste/heredoc block: combine the
repeated Type/Enter lines into one heredoc payload (start a cat << 'EOF' block,
include the static lines in one paste, then close with EOF) so the tape sends
the whole static input in one step; remove the extra individual Type/Enter
entries and use the single Paste/heredoc step to improve speed and robustness.

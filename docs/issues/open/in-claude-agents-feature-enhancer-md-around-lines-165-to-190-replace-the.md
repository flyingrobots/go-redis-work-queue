In .claude/agents/feature-enhancer.md around lines 165 to 190, replace the
inline XML-commented hard-coded color block with a reusable reference to
docs/colors.yml (key: feature_enhancement_palette) and present the palette as a
concise Markdown table of Category / Token / Hex (e.g., Background: canvas ->
#0d1117, panel -> #161b22; Border: default -> #30363d, success -> #238636, error
-> #f85149, warning -> #ffa657; Text: primary -> #f0f6fc, secondary -> #8b949e,
link -> #58a6ff, success -> #39d353, error -> #f85149; Buttons: primary ->
#238636, secondary -> #30363d, info -> #58a6ff). Remove the XML comment block
and add a short sentence pointing readers to docs/colors.yml for the canonical
source and the Markdown table for quick reference.

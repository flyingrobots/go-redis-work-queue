```text
In create_review_tasks.py around lines 57 and 91, the coverage threshold is
inconsistent (one place says "Achieved 90%+ test coverage" while instructions
elsewhere say 80%); choose the correct single requirement (e.g., 90%) and update
both occurrences to the chosen value so the "definition_of_done" and any
instructional text match exactly; ensure any related variable names, comments,
or documentation in the file that reference the coverage percentage are updated
to the same value for consistency.

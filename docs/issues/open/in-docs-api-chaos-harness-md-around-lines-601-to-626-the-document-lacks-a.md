In docs/api/chaos-harness.md around lines 601 to 626, the document lacks a
clear, global timestamp format; update this section to state that all timestamps
use RFC 3339 in UTC (e.g., 2025-09-18T14:30:00Z) and add a single sentence near
the top of the Metrics/Report/Troubleshooting areas noting "Timestamps are RFC
3339 in UTC" so examples and time-series graphs uniformly follow that format.

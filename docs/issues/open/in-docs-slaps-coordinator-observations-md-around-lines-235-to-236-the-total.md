In docs/SLAPS/coordinator-observations.md around lines 235 to 236, the "Total
Runtime: ~7 hours (with two 4.5-hour rate limit pauses)" phrasing is confusing;
change it to clearly separate active compute time and wall-clock time by
replacing that line with something like "Active compute time: ~7 hours;
Wall-clock time (including two 4.5-hour pauses): ~16 hours" so readers
immediately understand the distinction between processing time and elapsed time.

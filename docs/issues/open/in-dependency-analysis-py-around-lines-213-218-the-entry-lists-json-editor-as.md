In dependency_analysis.py around lines 213-218, the entry lists "json_editor" as
both a hard dependency and a provided capability; update the provides list to
disambiguate by renaming the provided capability to "json_editor_ui" (leave the
hard dependency as "json_editor") and search/replace any local references to the
old provided name so consumers use "json_editor_ui".

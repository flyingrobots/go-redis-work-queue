In claude_worker.py lines 1-5, the module currently has a short descriptive
comment but lacks a proper module docstring describing usage and contracts;
replace the placeholder with a real triple-quoted module docstring that
documents how to run the worker, required environment variables/CLI args, the
expected coordination directory layout, the exact JSON schema for task files
(fields, types, required/optional), file naming and lock/claim semantics,
error-handling expectations and return codes, and examples of typical input and
output; keep it concise, accurate, and in reStructuredText or Google-style so
callers and future maintainers can implement and validate producers/consumers
against these contracts.

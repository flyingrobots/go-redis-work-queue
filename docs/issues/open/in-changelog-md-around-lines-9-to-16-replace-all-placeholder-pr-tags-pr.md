```text
In CHANGELOG.md around lines 9 to 16, replace all placeholder PR tags "[#PR?]"
with the real PR number "(#3)" and rewrite the vague "Queue length gauge updater
to surface backlog metrics" line to explicitly name the metric and behavior (for
example: "Periodic updater for the queue_length backlog gauge to surface queue
backlog metrics (#3)"). Make the change for each list item so every bullet ends
with "(#3)" and the queue metric bullet clearly states the metric name and that
a periodic updater/background job updates it to report backlog.

In EVENT_HOOKS_TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md around lines 24 to 27, the integration test
"TestWebhookDeliveryWithRetries" is incorrectly listed under unit tests for
signatures; remove that entry from the unit-test list and add it to the Webhook
Harness (integration) section or note it as a separate integration scenario.
Update the documentation to either split the test into a unit and integration
entry or relocate the integration entry, and adjust headings/bullet grouping so
unit tests only contain true unit tests and integration scenarios appear under
the Webhook Harness section.

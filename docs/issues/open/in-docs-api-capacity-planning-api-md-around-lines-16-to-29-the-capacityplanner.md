In docs/api/capacity-planning-api.md around lines 16 to 29, the CapacityPlanner
interface references types (PlanRequest, PlanResponse, PlannerConfig,
PlannerState, context.Context) that are not defined or linked, making the API
doc incomplete; add definitions for each referenced type directly in this
document (struct fields, field types and optional descriptions) or add clear
links to the generated API/type reference for each type, and ensure any imported
types (e.g., context.Context) are noted with their package and a link; keep the
format consistent with the rest of the doc and update the table of contents or
header to reflect the added type definitions.
